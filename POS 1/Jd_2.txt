The/DT busiest/JJS places/NNS along/IN the/DT East/NNP Coast/NNP Road/NNP stretch/NN late/RB at/IN night/NN are/VBP Astons/NNP on/IN one/CD end/NN and/CC HK/NNP Cafe/NNP on/IN the/DT other/MM./. These/NNP places/NNS are/VBP packed/VBN even/RB after/IN 10/CDpm/CD !/. So/RB along/IN comes/NNS Cafe/NNP Oliv/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ strategically/RB located/VBN in/IN between/IN these/DT two/CD night/NN haunts/NNS offering/VBG Value-for-Money/NN ,/, mid-range/JJ Western/NNP Food/NNP right/NN up/IN till/NN Midnight/NN./. I/PRP 'd/MD say/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ sure/JJ win/NN situation/NN as/IN long/RB as/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ good/RB./. And/CC the/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ pretty/RB decent/JJ overall/NN with/IN a/DT few/JJ items/NNS worth/NN mentioning/VBG./. The/DT first/CD is/VBZ the/DT Battered/NNP Soft/NNP Shell/NNP Crab/NNP with/IN Salted/VBD Egg/NN./. Great/RB for/IN those/DT who/WP are/VBP battling/VBG a/DT low/JJ cholesterol/NN level/NN./. It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT pretty/RB tasty/JJ morsel/NN to/TO whet/VB one/CD 's/POS appetite/NN./. Though/CC it/PRP is/VBZ nice/JJ on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, I/PRP think/VBP a/DT bit/NN of/IN seasoned/VBN Japanese/JJ rice/NN or/CC other/JJ carb/NN would/MD go/VB very/RB well/RB to/TO balance/VB the/DT salty/NN savoury/NN taste/NN of/IN the/DT crab/NN and/CC salted/VBD egg/NN./. 4/5/CD Pork/NNP Ribs/NNP $/$ 14.90/CD If/IN you/PRP like/VBP Ribs/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ one/CD that/WDT you/PRP would/MD want/VB to/TO try/VB./. The/DT homemade/NN BBQ/NNP sauce/NN is/VBZ excellent/NN and/CC the/DT ribs/NNS are/VBP cooked/VBN till/NN the/DT meat/NN is/VBZ tender/NN and/CC separates/VBZ easily/RB from/IN the/DT bone/NN./. Just/RB before/IN serving/VBG ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB quickly/RB grilled/VBN so/RB that/IN you/PRP get/VBP that/IN nice/NN chargrill/NN taste/NN./. What/WP I/PRP find/VBP most/RBS exciting/JJ is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP use/VBP a/DT very/RB special/JJ cut/NN of/IN ribs/NNS specially/RB imported/VBN from/IN Germany/NNP which/WDT includes/VBZ the/DT soft/JJ bones/NNS at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN it/PRP./. You/PRP can/MD see/VB just/RB how/WRB long/JJ the/DT rack/NN is/WBZ./. For/INs me/PRP THIS/DT IS/VBZ the/DT best/JJS part/NN of/IN the/DT pork/NN ribs/NNS./. And/CC the/DT ribs/NNS are/VBP slow/JJ cooked/VBN till/NN the/DT soft/JJ bones/NNS are/VBP just/RB about/IN gelatinised/VBN so/RB the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN can/MD be/VB eaten/VBN./. Oh/EX yes/EX ,/, this/DT bit/NN really/RB sets/VBZ it/PRP apart/RB from/IN all/DT the/DT rest/NN !/. 4.5/5/CD Lamb/NNP Shank/NNP $/$ 14.95/CD The/DT Lamb/NNP Shank/NNP gets/VBZ my/PRP$ pick/NN for/IN the/DT Best/JJS Value/NNP Lamb/NNP Shank/NNP in/IN town/NN !/. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB come/VBN across/IN a/DT 600g/CD lamb/NN shank/NN for/IN less/JJR than/IN $/$ 15/CD./.s If/IN you/PRP love/VBP to/TO eat/VB lots/NNS of/IN meat/NN and/CC want/VB to/TO pay/VB as/IN little/JJ as/IN possible/JJ ,/, this/DT one/CD is/VBZ for/IN you/PRP !/. The/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT stewing/NN sauce/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ ,/, albeit/NN a/DT predictable/JJ "/"Ghoulash/NNP "/" type/NN sauce/NN./. The/DT meat/NN was/VBD tender/JJ but/CC we/PRP felt/VBD that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB even/RB better/RBR if/IN it/PRP was/VBD stewed/VBN just/RB a/DT little/RB longer/RBR./. 4/5/CD Beer/NNP Batter/NNP Fish/NNP $/$ 10.90/CD The/DT beer/NN batter/NN fish/NN was/VBD nicely/RB done/VBN./. I/PRP am/VBZ accustomed/VBN to/TO beer/NN batter/NN being/VBG really/RB thick/JJ and/CC oily/RB ,/, so/RB this/DT thin/JJ and/CC crispy/NN beer/NN batter/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT surprise/NN./. Chef/NN and/CC owner/NN Kevin/NNP Heng/NNP uses/VBZ a/DT bit/NN of/IN tumeric/JJ to/TO coat/VB the/DT fish/JJ to/TO give/VB it/PRP a/DT bit/NN of/IN colour/PRP$ and/CC curry/NN flavour/NN./. At/IN $/$ 10.90/CD it/PRP is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ value/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP comparing/VBG it/PRP to/TO Fish/VB &/CC amp/VB ;/: Co./NNP The/NNP fish/JJ is/VBZ well/RB seasoned/VBN and/CC served/VBN with/IN potato/NN wedges/NNS./. But/CC a/DT Dory/NNP is/VBZ a/DT Dory/NNP if/IN you/PRP know/VBP what/WP I/PRP mean./NNP So/NNP do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB any/DT big/JJ surprises/NNS tastewise/NN./. 4/5/CD Conclusion/NN Yet/CC another/DT new/JJ cafe/NN in/IN town/NN offering/NN "/"Value/JJ for/IN Money/NNP "/"western/NN food/NN./. But/CC do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB to/TO pay/VB $/$ 6/CD for/IN a/DT main/JJ meal/NN here/NN./. The/DT meals/NNS are/VBP a/DT little/RB more/RBR upmarket/NN but/CC we/PRP still/RB felt/VBD that/IN the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP very/RB reasonable/JJ for/IN what/WP you/PRP are/VBP getting/VBG./. Cafe/NNP Oliv/NNP aspires/VBZ to/TO offer/VB more/JJR creative/JJ fare/NN to/TO differentiate/VB itself/PRP from/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT crowd/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB Chef/NNP Kevin/NNP push/NN the/DT envelop/NN of/IN creativity/NN further/RBR./. The/DT other/JJ thing/NN that/WDT is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB add/VB the/DT GST/NNP or/CC Service/NNP Charge/NNP here/RB and/CC are/VBP open/JJ till/NN 12/CD midnight/NN./. It/PRP is/VBZ great/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT trend/NN of/IN offering/NN affordable/JJ western/NN food/NN gaining/VBG momentum/NN and/CC moving/VBG upmarket/NN./. It/PRP can/MD only/RB be/VB good/JJ news/NN for/IN all/DT of/IN us/PRP !/. Now/RB this/DT is/VBZ what/WP I/PRP call/VBP a/DT balanced/VBN meal/NN./. You/PRPs have/VBP your/PRP$ Beef/NNP ,/, your/PRP$ Pork/NNP and/CC your/PRP$ Fish/NNP all/DT on/IN the/DT one/CD plate/NN./. Cafe/NNP Oliv/NNP 's/POS Burger/NNP Trio/NNP is/VBZ best/JJS for/IN people/NNS who/WP :/: 1/CD./. Ca/RB n't/RB make/VB up/RP their/PRP$ minds/NNS what/WP to/TO eat/VB 2/CD./. Want/VBP their/PRP$ Burgers/NNS in/IN manageable/JJ portions/NNS 3/CD./. Love/VB to/TO buy/VB a/DT dish/JJ to/TO share/VB with/IN their/PRP$ friends/NNS 4/CD./. Prefer/VB to/TO taste/VB different/JJ things/NNS rather/RB than/IN stuffing/VBG a/DT hungry/NN stomach/NN Three/CD Burgers/NNS means/VBZ three/CD reviews/NNS ,/, so/RB here/RB we/PRP go/VBP :/: Starting/NNP with/IN the/DT Beef/NN./. This/DT is/VBZ 2/CD slices/NNS of/IN tenderloin/NN beef/NN ,/, with/IN bacon/NN ,/, cheese/JJ and/CC lettuce/NN in/IN a/DT tennis/NN ball/NN sized/VBD bun/NN./. Though/CC I/PRP love/VBP beef/JJ ,/, tenderloin/NN is/VBZ not/RB my/PRP$ favourite/NN cut/VBD as/IN it/PRP lacks/VBZ a/DT beefy/NN flavour/NN./. But/CC ,/, I/PRP know/VBP lots/NNS of/IN ladies/NNS who/WP love/RB it/PRP because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ tender/JJR and/CC has/VBZ less/JJR fat/NN./. Personally/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD prefer/VB a/DT nice/JJ thick/NN hamburger/NN pattie/NN instead/RB./. Next/CC up/IN is/VBZ the/DT Kong/NNP Bak/NNP./ I/PRP actually/RB quite/RB like/IN this/DT one/CD./. The/DT Kong/NNP Bak/NNP was/VBD braised/VBN till/NN it/PRP is/VBZ tender/JJR ,/, well/RB caramelised/VBN with/IN just/RB a/DT hint/NN of/IN the/DT five/CD spices/NNS./. The/DT Kong/NNP Bak/NNP is/VBZ much/JJ better/NN than/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT Kong/NNP Bak/NNP from/IN franchised/VBN Kong/NNP Bak/NNP Pau/NNP outlets/NNS./. Worth/VB spending/NN some/DT calories/NNS on/IN this/DT one/CD./. I/PRP have/VBP left/VBN the/DT best/JJS course/NN for/IN last/VB./. The/DT Teriyaki/NNP Cod/NNP Fish/NNP with/IN Shitake/NNP Mushrooms/NNP burger/NN is/VBZ worth/JJ the/DT trip/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD n't/RB mind/VB having/VBG all/DT three/CD as/IN Cod/NNP Fish/NNP burgers/NNS./. They/PRP use/VBP Canadian/JJ Black/NNP Cod/NNP here/RB so/RB the/DT flesh/JJ is/VBZ oily/RB and/CC smooth/DT and/CC it/PRP was/VBD fried/VBN till/NN there/RB was/VBD a/DT crust/JJ of/IN caramel/NN on/IN the/DT flesh/NN./. It/PRP was/VBD really/RB juicy/NN and/CC the/DT combination/NN of/IN the/DT Shitake/NNP ,/, Teriyaki/NNP sauce/NN and/CC salad/VBD really/RB worked/VBD./. Come/VB to/TO think/VB of/IN it/PRP ,/, I/PRP would/MD n't/RB mind/VB a/DT full/JJ sized/VBN Cod/NNP Fish/NNP Burger/NNP !/. The/DT concept/NN of/IN the/DT mini/NN burger/NN has/VBZ been/VBN tried/VBN elsewhere/RB but/CC I/PRP think/VBP this/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN that/WDT it/PRP has/VBZ come/VBN in/IN three/CD different/JJ flavors/NNS./. Personally/RB it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN perfect/JJ if/IN they/PRP provided/VBD a/DT juicy/NN burger/NN pattie/NN instead/RB of/IN tenderloin/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VBP the/DT tenderloin/NN would/MD appeal/VB to/TO a/DT lot/NN of/IN ladies/NNS out/IN there/RB ./. I/PRP lived/VBD in/IN Melbourne/NNP ,/, Australia/NNP during/IN my/PRP$ university/NN days/NNS and/CC it/PRP was/VBD during/IN my/PRP$ time/NN there/EX that/WDT I/PRP discovered/VBD my/PRP$ favorite/NN flavor/NN of/IN fried/VBD rice/NN./. It/PRP was/VBD (/( and/CC still/RB is/VBZ )/C served/VBN at/IN this/DT place/NN on/IN Elizabeth/NNP Street/NNP called/VBD Rose/NNP Garden/NNP BBQ/NNP Shop/NNP./.
