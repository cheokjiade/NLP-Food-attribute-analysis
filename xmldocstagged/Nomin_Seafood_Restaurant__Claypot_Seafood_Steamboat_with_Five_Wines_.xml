<text>I/PRP get/VB plenty/NN of/IN emails/NN from/IN people/NN recommending/VBG food/NN places/NNS that/IN they/PRP would/MD like/VB me/PRP to/TO blog/VB ./. The/DT list/NN of/IN recommendations/NN is/VBZ so/RB long/JJ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO decide/VB which/WDT one/CD to/TO go/VB try/VB ./. So/RB often/VB it/PRP is/VBZ those/RB really/RB outstanding/JJ ones/NNS that/IN catch/NN my/PRP$ attention/NN ./. This/DT one/CD ,/, recommended/NN by/IN our/PRP$ regular/JJ makankaki/NN ,/, holydrummer/NN was/VBD exactly/RB the/DT type/NN that/WDT got/VBD me/PRP excited/RB when/WRB he/PRP boldly/JJ stated/NN :/: ``/NNP DIE/NNP DIE/NNP MUST/NNP TRY/NNP !!!/NNP 5/CD different/JJ kinds/NN of/IN wines/NNS !/. The/DT Cuttlefish/NN Kangkong/NN is/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ variation/NN of/IN the/DT familiar/JJ sambal/NN kangkong/NN ./. The/DT chilli/NN was/VBD full/JJ of/IN hae/JJ bee/NN -LRB-/IN dried/JJ prawns/NNS -RRB-/NN and/CC was/VBD so/RB tasty/JJ that/IN both/DT my/JJ mother/NN and/CC mother-in-law/NN finished/IN the/DT dish/NN before/IN I/PRP could/MD get/VB a/DT second/JJ bite/VB of/IN it/PRP ./. As/IN Prawn/NNP Paste/NNP Chicken/NNP goes/VBZ ,/, the/DT prawn/NN paste/NN flavor/NN was/VBD not/RB strong/JJ enough/RB ./. But/CC as/IN fried/JJ chicken/NN goes/VBZ ,/, this/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN is/VBZ quite/RB good/JJ ./. Crispy/NNP on/IN the/DT outside/NN ,/, juicy/NN on/IN the/DT inside/NN and/CC well/RB seasoned/JJ ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ good/JJ as/IN long/JJ as/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB of/IN it/PRP as/IN prawn/NN paste/NN chicken/NN ./. Great/JJ place/NN for/IN a/DT family/NN dinner/NN ./. The/DT 5/CD wine/NN and/CC herbal/NN soup/NN base/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ and/CC the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP reasonable/JJ ./. Place/NN to/TO consider/VB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN something/NN a/DT little/JJ different/JJ from/IN your/PRP$ usual/JJ steamboat/NN ./. </text>
