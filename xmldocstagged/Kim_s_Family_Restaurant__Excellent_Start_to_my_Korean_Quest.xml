<title>Kim's Family Restaurant: Excellent Start to my Korean Quest</title>
<text>I/PRP guess/VBP like/IN many/JJ people/NNS ,/, my/PRP$ interest/NN in/IN Korean/NNP food/NN started/VBD as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN watching/VBG K/NNP drama/NNP ./. It/PRP did/VBD n't/RB really/RB take/VB off/IN after/IN ``/NN Stairway/NN to/TO Heaven/VB ''/NN which/WRB I/PRP felt/VBD was/VBD a/DT series/NN to/TO test/VB your/PRP$ endurance/NN for/IN ``/NN Chee/NN Kekness/NN ''/NN -LRB-/NN frustration/NN -RRB-/NN ./. But/CC interest/JJ begin/NN to/TO brew/VB after/IN ``/NNP Sik/NNP Gek/NNP ''/NN and/CC blossomed/NN in/IN ``/NNP Da/NNP Chang/NNP Jing/NNP ''/NNP ./. So/RB now/RB I/PRP am/VBP on/IN my/PRP$ Korean/NNP food/NNP hunt/NN to/TO find/VB the/DT best/JJS that/WDT the/DT culture/NN has/VBZ to/TO offer/VB ./. Before/IN this/DT ,/, the/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP really/RB liked/VBD about/IN Korean/NNP food/NN was/VBD the/DT table/NN BBQ/NN ./. That/DT 's/POS not/RB because/IN the/DT other/JJ stuff/NN was/VBD bad/JJ ,/, it/PRP 's/POS just/RB that/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB know/VB what/WP else/RB to/TO order/VB ./. In/IN fact/NN ,/, I/PRP still/RB do/VBP n't/RB really/RB know/VB what/WP to/TO eat/VB ,/, but/CC as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN K/NN Drama/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP more/JJ interested/NNS in/IN exploring/NN ./. And/CC it/PRP helps/VBZ when/WRB my/PRP$ friend/NN Cactuskit/NN just/RB happens/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT K/JJ Drama/NN addict/NN and/CC eats/NNP Korean/NNP food/NN almost/RB every/DT week/NN ./. In/IN fact/NN ,/, Cactuskit/NN is/VBZ like/IN a/DT drug/NN trafficker/NN who/WP goes/VBZ around/RB getting/VBG people/NN addicted/NN to/TO K/VB Drama/NN ./. So/RB let/VB 's/POS talk/VB Korean/NNP food/NN ./. The/DT most/NN unique/JJ thing/NN about/IN Korean/NNP food/NN is/VBZ the/DT -LRB-/JJ side/NN dishes/NNS -RRB-/RB which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT way/NN the/DT Koreans/NN made/VBD sure/JJ that/IN you/PRP ate/VBD your/PRP$ veggies/NN ./. Amongst/DT all/PDT the/DT ,/, the/DT one/CD that/WDT stands/VBZ out/IN is/VBZ of/IN course/NN ,/, -LRB-/NNP Preserved/NNP veggies/NNP -RRB-/NNP and/CC in/IN particular/JJ the/DT made/VBD from/IN Chinese/NNP Cabbage/NN known/VBN as/IN ./. I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN on/IN many/JJ occasions/NNS and/CC I/PRP still/RB do/VBP n't/RB get/VB why/WRB the/DT Koreans/NN would/MD love/VB it/PRP so/RB much/JJ that/IN almost/RB every/DT household/NN makes/VBZ their/PRP$ own/JJ and/CC store/NN it/PRP in/IN a/DT separate/JJ fridge/NN ./. The/DT thing/NN that/WDT would/MD first/RB impress/VB you/PRP at/IN Kim/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ their/PRP$ selection/NN of/IN ./. It/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB matter/VB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP dining/VBG with/IN ten/CD or/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP the/DT only/RB person/JJ dining/NN ,/, the/DT people/NN at/IN Kim/NNP 's/POS would/MD fill/VB your/PRP$ table/NN with/IN 8/CD to/TO 12/CD banchan/NN dishes/NNS ,/, all/DT of/IN which/WDT have/VB been/VBN made/VBD in/IN house/NN ./. That/DT means/NN that/WDT for/IN $/$ 8/CD +/NN for/IN a/DT beef/NN bulgolgi/NN meal/NN ,/, you/PRP get/VB a/DT table/JJ covered/NN with/IN !/. And/CC believe/VB it/PRP or/CC not/RB ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT standard/JJ dishes/NNS is/VBZ a/DT steamed/JJ whole/JJ fish/NN with/IN chilli/NN and/CC long/JJ beans/NNS ./. Every/JJ table/NN gets/VBZ one/CD ,/, even/RB if/IN you/PRP only/RB order/VB one/CD dish/NN ./. I/PRP think/VB that/WDT reason/NN alone/NN accounts/NN for/IN the/DT huge/NN popularity/NN of/IN the/DT restaurants/NN amongst/NN our/JJ facebook/NN readers/NNS !/. One/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJ popular/JJ dishes/NNS here/RB is/VBZ the/DT spicy/JJ fried/VBD pork/NN -LRB-/NN jeyuk/NN bokum/NN -RRB-/NN which/WDT is/VBZ highly/RB recommended/JJ ./. One/CD thing/NN good/JJ about/IN Korean/NNP food/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP might/VB look/VB fiery/JJ but/CC the/DT heat/NN from/IN the/DT chilli/NN is/VBZ mild/RB compared/VBD to/TO what/WP we/PRP are/VBP used/VBN to/TO ./. The/DT smoky/NN spiciness/NN of/IN this/DT dish/NN is/VBZ quite/RB unique/JJ and/CC it/PRP goes/VBZ really/RB well/RB with/IN rice/NN ./. This/DT type/NN of/IN chilli/NN paste/NN based/VBD stir/RB fried/VBD dish/NN is/VBZ very/RB popular/JJ in/IN Korean/NNP cuisine/NN but/CC I/PRP still/RB have/VBP n't/RB figured/VB out/IN why/WRB the/DT Koreans/NN love/RB chilli/NN so/IN much/JJ ./. Most/JJS countries/NN that/WDT love/VBP chilli/NNS are/VBP situated/VBN in/IN hot/JJ climates/NNS where/WRB chillies/NND are/VBP used/VBD because/IN it/PRP masks/VBZ the/DT taste/NN of/IN less-than-fresh/NN meat/NN and/CC also/RB acts/VB to/TO kill/VB bacteria/NN ./. Korea/DT is/VBZ probably/RB the/DT coldest/JJ country/NN with/IN a/DT passion/NN for/IN chilli/NN ./. We/PRP have/VBN to/TO thank/VB the/DT Koreans/NN for/IN giving/VBG us/PRP the/DT table/JJ BBQ/NN style/NN of/IN eating/NN ./. You/PRP might/VB argue/VB that/IN the/DT Japanese/NN also/RB have/VB their/PRP$ Yakiniku/NNP ,/, but/CC they/PRP learned/VBP it/PRP from/IN the/DT Koreans/JJ first/JJ ./. When/WRB you/PRP order/VB from/IN a/DT Japanese/NN restaurant/NN ,/, that/IN word/NN is/VBZ actually/RB a/DT derivation/NN of/IN the/DT Korean/NNP word/NN galbi/NN which/WDT is/VBZ used/VBD to/TO denote/VB that/IN part/NN of/IN meat/NN that/WDT is/VBZ near/JJ to/TO the/DT ribs/NNS of/IN either/NN pork/NN ,/, beef/NN or/CC chicken/NN ./. The/DT Japanese/NN however/NN use/VB only/RB to/TO denote/VB Beef/NNP Short/NNP Ribs/NNP ./. Kim/DT 's/POS probably/RB has/VBZ the/DT cheapest/JJS USDA/NN around/IN at/IN $/$ 23/CD for/IN a/DT 200g/NN serving/VBG ./. Chef/NNP Bong/NNP Gu/NNP tries/NN to/TO reduce/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN sugar/NN in/IN his/PRP$ food/NN ,/, so/IN his/PRP$ marinade/NN is/VBZ not/RB as/IN sweet/JJ as/IN many/JJ other/JJ restaurants/NN ./. The/DT meat/NN is/VBZ tender/JJ and/CC flavourful/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP do/VBP like/IN my/PRP$ just/RB a/DT little/JJ sweeter/NN ./. Korean/NNP food/NN is/VBZ really/RB quite/RB healthy/JJ as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ often/RB made/VBD with/IN lots/NNS of/IN vegetables/NNS ./. So/RB if/IN you/PRP order/VB a/DT ,/, you/PRP get/VB five/CD vegetables/NNS and/CC one/CD meat/NN ./. In/IN addition/NN to/TO that/WDT ,/, you/PRP have/VBP another/DT 8/CD side/NN dishes/NNS which/WRB includes/VBZ the/DT aforementioned/NN ,/, which/WRB incidentally/NN is/VBZ listed/JJ as/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT world/NN 's/POS healthiest/NN foods/NN !/. I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN trying/VBG out/IN the/DT at/IN several/JJ restaurants/NN lately/NN and/CC the/DT one/CD at/IN Kim/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ certainly/RB not/RB bad/JJ ./. I/PRP really/RB ca/MD n't/RB give/VB you/PRP an/DT objective/JJ opinion/NN as/IN to/TO how/RB good/JJ the/DT is/VBZ because/IN I/PRP really/RB have/VB n't/RB eaten/VBD one/CD what/WP I/PRP could/MD say/VB was/VBD the/DT gold/NN standard/JJ ./. So/RB ,/, is/VBZ this/DT one/CD as/IN good/JJ as/IN it/PRP gets/VBZ ?/. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB so/RB ./. Is/WBZ there/EX one/CD out/IN there/RB somewhere/NN that/WDT would/MD really/RB hit/VB the/DT spot/NN for/IN me/PRP ?/. I/PRP honestly/VB do/VB n't/RB know/VB ./. But/CC at/IN $/$ 10/CD with/IN a/DT whole/JJ table/NN of/IN side/NN dishes/NNS ,/, I/PRP can/MD say/VB that/WDT this/DT is/VBZ a/DT value/NN for/IN money/NN place/NN to/TO try/VB it/PRP !/. We/PRP were/VBD told/JJ that/WDT one/CD of/IN the/DT most/JJ popular/JJ dishes/NNS at/IN the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ the/DT seafood/NN pancake/NN which/WDT is/VBZ essentially/RB a/DT fried/JJ batter/NN of/IN wheat/NN and/CC potato/NN flour/NN with/IN veggies/NN and/CC seafood/NN in/IN the/DT middle/JJ and/CC topped/VBD with/IN eggs/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ./. Not/RB a/DT umami/NN bomb/NN like/IN oyster/NN omelette/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT chewy/JJ texture/NN of/IN the/DT flour/NN batter/NN lends/VBZ a/DT subtle/JJ starchy/JJ sweetness/NN to/TO complement/VB the/DT seafood/NN in/IN every/DT mouthful/NN ./. Kim/DT 's/POS is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO start/VB exploring/NNP Korean/NNP cuisine/NN ./. The/DT chef/NN owner/NN ,/, Bong/NN Gu/NN is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ Korean/NNP chef/NN who/WP has/VBZ been/VBN cooking/NN in/IN Korean/NNP restaurants/NN for/IN 30/CD years/NNS before/RB coming/VBG to/TO Singapore/NNP to/TO work/VB in/IN some/DT other/JJ Korean/NNP kitchens/NNP before/IN venturing/VBG out/RP to/TO open/VB his/PRP$ own/JJ restaurant/NN ./. The/DT whole/JJ place/NN is/VBZ run/NN by/IN his/PRP$ family/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ as/IN homely/NN and/CC genuine/NN as/IN Korean/NNP cuisine/NN can/MD get/VB in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. Plus/JJ ,/, the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP very/RB reasonable/JJ ./. Both/JJ Soundman/NN and/CC I/PRP left/VBN the/DT restaurant/NN knowing/NN that/WDT we/PRP will/VB be/VB bringing/VBD back/RB the/DT makan/NN kakis/NNS very/RB soon/RB ./.
