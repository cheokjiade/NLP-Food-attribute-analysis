<title>Seng Huat Bak Kut Teh Restoran: The Origins of Bak Kut Teh continued...</title>
<text>My/PRP$ search/NN for/IN the/DT origins/NNS of/IN Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP has/VBZ finally/RB brought/VBN me/PRP to/TO Klang/VB ,/, the/DT place/NN where/RB many/JJ Malaysians/NNS believe/VB to/TO be/VB the/DT birthplace/NN of/IN Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP ./. There/EX is/VBZ not/RB doubt/VB that/IN the/DT people/NN of/IN Klang/NN thrive/NN ,/, nay/NN ,/, survive/NN on/IN this/DT veritable/NN mix/NN of/IN various/JJ pork/NN parts/NNS simmered/VBD in/IN a/DT dark/JJ and/CC powerful/JJ herbal/NN concoction/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ that/IN they/PRP have/VBP over/RB a/DT hundred/JJ shops/NN in/IN this/DT small/JJ town/NN serving/VBG Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP and/CC some/JJ Klangers/NN can/MD have/VB it/PRP for/IN breakfast/NN everyday/NN !/. The/DT Malaysian/JJ Tourism/NN Minister/NN claimed/NN in/IN 2009/NN that/IN Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP was/VBD Malaysian/JJ in/IN origin/NN ./. Actually/RB I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB blame/VB her/PRP for/IN saying/VBG what/WP she/PRP did/VBD because/IN that/WDT is/VBZ what/WP they/PRP actually/RB believe/VB ./. According/VBG to/TO their/PRP$ story/NN ,/, this/DT particular/JJ stall/NN ,/, Seng/NNP Huat/NNP was/VBD the/DT very/RB first/JJ Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP stall/NN which/WRB was/VBD set/NN up/NN just/RB after/IN WWII/NN ./. The/DT founder/NN 's/POS name/NN was/VBD Lee/RB Wen/JJ Di/NN 李文地/NN and/CC he/PRP started/VBD selling/VBG his/PRP mix/NN of/IN Pork/NNP Bone/NNP Soup/NN which/WRB became/VBD so/RB famous/JJ that/IN they/PRP called/VBD the/DT dish/NN after/IN him/PRP ./. In/IN the/DT early/NN days/NNS ,/, 肉骨茶/NNP Rou/NNP Gu/NNP Cha/NNP -LRB-/NNP Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP -RRB-/NNP was/VBD n't/RB called/VBD Rou/NNP Gu/NNP Cha/NNP but/CC 肉骨汤/NNP Rou/NNP Gu/NNP Tang/NNP ./. But/CC because/IN Lee/NNP Wen/NNP Di/NNP 's/POS dish/NN was/VBD so/RB popular/JJ ,/, they/PRP started/VBD to/TO call/VBP it/PRP 肉骨地/RB Rou/JJ Gu/NN Di/NN which/WDT in/IN the/DT Hokkien/NN dialect/NN is/VBZ pronounced/JJ Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP ./. You/PRP can/MD read/VB the/DT story/NN for/IN yourselves/NN in/IN the/DT newspaper/NN cutting/VBG ./. Having/VBG this/DT piece/NN of/IN documentation/NN is/VBZ important/JJ in/IN my/PRP$ search/NN for/IN the/DT origins/NNS of/IN Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP because/IN it/PRP gives/VBZ us/PRP$ a/DT reference/JJ point/NN in/IN time/NN ./. I/PRP do/VBP not/RB doubt/VB that/IN perhaps/NN that/WDT is/VBZ how/RB the/DT name/NN Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP originated/NNP in/IN Klang/NNP but/CC in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, we/PRP do/VBP have/VBN evidence/VBN that/IN Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP was/VBD already/RB being/VBG served/VBD around/IN the/DT Clarke/JJ Quay/NN area/NN before/IN the/DT war/NN ./. I/PRP spoke/VBD again/RB to/TO the/DT boss/NN of/IN Pek/NNP Sin/NNP Choon/NNP Tea/NNP Merchants/NNP ,/, Kenry/NNP Peh/NNP ,/, whose/NNP grandfather/NNP started/VBD the/DT Tea/NN business/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP before/IN the/DT war/NN ./. He/PRP told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT his/PRP$ 大伯/JJ Tua/NNP Peh/NNP -LRB-/NNP Oldest/NNP paternal/NNP uncle/NNP -RRB-/NNP ,/, Mr/NNP Pek/NNP Bok/NNP Kim/NN ,/, 86/NN ,/, can/NN still/RB recall/VBP having/VBG Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP with/IN his/PRP$ grandfather/JJ Pek/NN Kim/NN Au/NN before/IN WWII/NN ./. Even/RB then/RB he/PRP remembered/VBZ that/IN they/PRP used/VBD to/TO serve/VB a/DT pot/NN of/IN tea/NN with/IN their/PRP$ pork/NN bone/NN soup/NN ./. In/IN my/PRP$ previous/JJ post/NN ,/, I/PRP stated/VBD that/IN Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP was/VBD a/DT Teochew/NNP invention/NNP ./. That/DT point/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB clarified/NN ./. As/IN far/JJ as/IN the/DT peppery/NN version/NN of/IN Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP is/VBZ concerned/RB ,/, yes/EX ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT Teochews/NN who/WP invented/VBZ it/PRP ./. However/RB ,/, pork/NN bone/NN soup/NN probably/RB is/VBZ Hokkien/VBN in/IN origin/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/WDT we/PRP Teochews/RB do/VBP n't/RB call/VBP meat/NN ``/IN Bak/NNP ''/NNP ,/, we/PRP call/VBP it/PRP ``/RB Nek/VBD ''/NN ./. So/CC the/DT name/NN Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP would/MD point/VB to/TO a/DT Hokkien/JJ origin/NN ./. However/RB ,/, the/DT practice/NN of/IN serving/VBG Gong/NNP Fu/NNP Tea/NNP is/VBZ Teochew/NNP in/IN origin/NN as/IN the/DT Teochews/NNS are/VBP famous/JJ for/IN being/VBG the/DT biggest/JJ tea/NN drinkers/NN in/IN China/NNP ./. So/RB what/WP we/PRP really/RB have/VB here/RB is/VBZ a/DT dish/NN that/WDT is/VBZ uniquely/RB Singaporean/VBN in/IN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD born/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT fusion/NN of/IN two/CD of/IN the/DT two/CD major/NN dialect/NN groups/NN who/WP migrated/VBZ here/RB ./. Origins/JJ aside/NN ,/, you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB dispute/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN Klang/NN really/RB is/VBZ the/DT place/NN for/IN Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP ./. My/PRP$ friend/NN Desmond/NN insisted/NN that/WDT we/PRP leave/VB our/PRP$ hotel/NN in/IN KL/NN at/IN 7am/NN in/IN the/DT morning/NN to/TO take/VB a/DT half/JJ an/DT hour/JJ taxi/NN ride/NN to/TO Klang/VB for/IN Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP because/IN ,/, as/IN I/PRP said/JJ earlier/NN ,/, people/NN in/IN Klang/NN can/MD eat/VB Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP almost/RB everyday/JJ and/CC the/DT places/NNS can/MD get/VB quite/RB packed/VBN later/VBN in/IN the/DT morning/NN ./. Seng/NNP Huat/NNP is/VBZ the/DT original/JJ Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP stall/NN but/CC we/PRP were/VBD told/JJ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB necessarily/VB the/DT best/JJS in/IN everyone/NNP 's/POS books/NN ./. When/WRB we/PRP got/VBD there/RB at/IN 7.30/PRP am/VBP ,/, the/DT place/NN was/VBD still/RB relatively/RB quiet/JJ and/CC the/DT young/JJ man/NN who/WP was/VBD busy/VB hacking/RB away/RB at/IN the/DT chopping/JJ block/JJ just/RB happens/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT third/JJ generation/NN owner/NN of/IN the/DT shop/NN ./. They/PRP sell/VB their/PRP$ Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP in/IN personal/JJ portions/NNS ,/, so/RB each/JJ person/NN gets/VBZ to/TO order/VB his/PRP$ own/JJ selection/NN of/IN porcine/NN anatomy/NN ./. What/WP makes/VBZ Klang/NNP Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP different/JJ from/IN Singapore/NNP 's/POS version/NN ,/, aside/NN from/IN the/DT strong/JJ herbal/NN element/NN in/IN the/DT soup/NN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP offer/VB more/JJ variety/NN of/IN pig/JJ parts/NNS ./. It/PRP was/VBD ironic/JJ that/WDT I/PRP ended/VB up/VB eating/VBG Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP with/IN pork/NN innards/VBZ and/CC meat/NN rather/RB than/IN pork/NN bone/NN as/IN the/DT prime/JJ ribs/NNS were/VBD already/RB sold/VBN out/IN by/IN 7.30/PRP am/VBP !/. I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN the/DT herbal/NN soup/NN is/VBZ rather/RB satisfying/JJ but/CC I/PRP personally/VB have/VB no/RB preference/VBD between/IN the/DT Singapore/NNP vs/NNP the/DT Malaysian/JJ versions/NN ./. I/PRP just/RB treat/VB them/PRP as/IN different/JJ dishes/NNS ./. Our/PRP$ survey/NNS on/IN our/PRP$ facebook/JJ page/NN however/NN ,/, showed/VBD that/IN Singaporeans/NNP preferred/NNP the/DT Malaysian/JJ Herbal/NN version/NN to/TO the/DT Pepper/JJ version/NN by/IN a/DT ratio/NN of/IN 3:2/NN ./. The/DT meat/NN is/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO rave/VB about/IN ./. I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB get/VB primeribs/NN so/IN I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB make/VB a/DT fair/JJ comparison/NN ,/, although/CC the/DT bits/NNS of/IN pork/NN that/IN I/PRP did/VBD get/VB was/VBD a/DT tad/NN dry/JJ ./. The/DT soup/NN is/VBZ of/IN course/NN ,/, very/RB robust/JJ and/CC fragrant/JJ ,/, albeit/NN slightly/RB bitter/JJ that/IN morning/NN ./. Still/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ pick-me-up/NN for/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN ./. 4.25/DT \//JJ 5/CD Conclusion/NN Seng/NNP Huat/NNP is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP can/MD imagine/VB Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP to/TO be/VB even/RB better/RBR based/VBD on/IN how/RB some/JJ people/NN can/MD rave/VB about/IN it/PRP !/. So/RB which/WDT is/VBZ your/PRP$ favorite/JJ Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP in/IN the/DT KL\/Klang/NN area/NN ?/. Seng/NNP Huat/NNP Restoran/NNP 9/LS ,/, Jalan/NN Besar/NN ,/, Klang/NN 60/CD 3/CD 3371/NN 2652/NN 7.30/NN am/VBZ --/JJ 2.00/NN pm/NN ,/, 5.00/NNP pm/NNP --/NNP 8.00/NNP pm/NNP ./. Closed/DT 1st/NN &amp;/CC 15th/NN on/IN Chinese/NNP Lunar/NNP Calendar/NNP GPS/NNP :/: N3/NNP 02.612/NNP E101/NNP 26.895/NNP Travel/NNP Notes/NNP :/: There/EX are/VBP several/JJ bridges/NNS in/IN Klang/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP cross/VB the/DT old/JJ bridge/NN and/CC you/PRP will/VB spot/VB the/DT signboard/NN at/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT shophouse/NN ,/, then/RB make/VB another/DT round/NN and/CC instead/RB of/IN going/NN over/IN the/DT bridge/NN ,/, keep/VB left/JJ and/CC go/VB under/IN the/DT bridge/NN ./. PS/RB go/VB early/NN ./. We/PRP were/VBD there/RB at/IN 7.30/PRP am/VBP and/CC the/DT crowds/NN were/VBD already/RB building/JJ up/NN ./. </text>
