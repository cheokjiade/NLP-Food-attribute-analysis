<title>You Huak Restaurant: White Bee Hoon!</title>
<text>This/DT Cze/NNP Char/NNP place/NN is/VBZ famous/JJ for/IN the/DT White/JJ Bee/NN Hoon/NN !/. White/JJ Bee/NN Hoon/NN ?/. Never/RB heard/VBN of/IN White/NN Bee/NN Hoon/NN ?/. Well/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB blame/VB you/PRP ,/, because/CC it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB quite/RB a/DT recognized/JJ Singapore/NN dish/NN yet/RB ./. I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ that/WDT there/EX are/VBP several/JJ places/NNS in/IN town/NN that/WDT serves/VBZ White/JJ Bee/NN Hoon/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT one/CD is/VBZ by/IN far/JJ the/DT most/NN famous/JJ ./. When/WRB I/PRP was/VBD doing/VBG my/PRP$ reservist/NN in/IN Nee/NNP Soon/NNP Camp/NNP ,/, I/PRP heard/VBN so/RB many/JJ recommendations/NN for/IN this/DT White/JJ Bee/NN Hoon/NN ,/, that/WDT we/PRP organized/VBD a/DT troop/NN movement/NN to/TO recce/VB it/PRP out/RB ./. Unfortunately/RB ,/, our/PRP first/JJ experience/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ disappointing/NN and/CC my/PRP$ reputation/NN as/IN a/DT foodie/NN took/VBD quite/RB a/DT beating/JJ amongst/NN my/PRP$ fellow/NN officers/NN ./. But/CC the/DT White/JJ Bee/NN Hoon/NN continues/VBZ to/TO hound/VB me/PRP as/IN I/PRP was/VBD searching/JJ for/IN new/JJ places/NNS up/IN North/JJ to/TO fill/VB my/PRP$ ieat/NN Hawker/NN App/NN ./. I/PRP just/RB could/MD n't/RB reconcile/VB my/PRP$ experience/NN with/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN all/DT their/PRP$ fans/NNS are/VBP willing/JJ to/TO wait/VB at/IN least/RB half/IN an/DT hour/NN to/TO an/DT hour/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ White/NN Bee/NN Hoon/MD fix/VB ./. So/RB ,/, a/DT 2nd/CD visit/NN was/VBD in/IN order/NN ./. This/DT time/NN round/NN ,/, the/DT White/JJ Bee/NN Hoon/NN was/VBD much/JJ better/NN ./. But/CC I/PRP think/VB that/WDT in/IN order/NN to/TO fully/VB appreciate/VB it/PRP ,/, you/PRP need/VB to/TO have/VB correct/RB some/JJ preconceived/NN ideas/NNS ./. If/IN you/PRP think/VB of/IN this/DT dish/NN like/IN a/DT Fried/NNP Hor/NNP Fun/NNP ,/, then/RB you/PRP will/VB be/VB disappointed/JJ because/IN the/DT Bee/NN Hoon/NN is/VBZ not/RB fried/VBN till/NN it/PRP has/VBZ that/IN Wok/NN Hei/NN flavor/NN before/IN being/VBG simmered/NN in/IN the/DT stock/NN ./. Instead/JJ ,/, if/IN you/PRP think/VB of/IN it/PRP as/IN a/DT dry/JJ XO/NN Bee/NN Hoon/NN ,/, then/RB you/PRP might/VB start/VB to/TO appreciate/VB it/PRP ./. Basically/RB the/DT Bee/NN Hoon/NN is/VBZ simmered/RB in/IN a/DT rich/JJ stock/NN made/VBD from/IN old/JJ mother/NN hens/NN and/CC the/DT dish/NN as/IN a/DT whole/JJ is/VBZ not/RB heavy/JJ on/IN the/DT palate/NN ./. It/PRP 's/POS more/NN like/IN a/DT pasta/NN really/RB ./. My/PRP$ initial/jj reaction/NN was/VBD still/RB that/IN it/PRP tasted/VBD a/DT little/JJ bland/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT dish/NN really/RB does/VBZ grow/RB on/IN you/PRP ./. What/WP the/DT kakis/NNS were/VBD really/RB impressed/JJ with/IN was/VBD the/DT Stir/NNP Fried/NNP Fish/NNP Head/NNP with/IN Bittergourd/NN ./. This/DT dish/NN ,/, like/IN the/DT White/JJ Bee/NN Hoon/NN ,/, is/VBZ a/DT creation/NN of/IN the/DT lady/NN boss/NN ./. The/DT secret/NN lies/VBZ an/DT an/DT aromatic/NN chilli/NN paste/NN with/IN has/VBZ the/DT perfect/JJ balance/NN of/IN savoury/NN ,/, spicy/JJ ,/, sweetness/NN and/CC tang/NN which/WDT is/VBZ quite/RB addictive/JJ ./. We/PRP all/RB gave/VBD it/PRP three/CD thumbs/NN up/NN !/. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD The/DT Ngor/NN Hiang/NN is/VBZ another/JJ dish/NN that/WDT is/VBZ highly/RB recommended/VBD by/IN fans/NNS ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ good/JJ but/CC I/PRP find/VB that/WDT there/EX are/VBP lots/RB of/IN other/JJ Cze/NNP Chars/NNP that/WDT also/RB make/VB good/JJ Ngor/NN Hiang/NN ,/, so/RB it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB easy/JJ to/TO say/VB how/RB this/DT one/CD stands/VBZ out/IN ./. One/PRP point/NN of/IN difference/NN is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP use/VBP a/DT fair/JJ amount/NN of/IN fish/NN paste/NN in/IN the/DT Ngor/NN Hiang/NN ,/, so/RB the/DT texture/NN tends/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT little/JJ finer/NN than/IN those/DT made/VBD purely/RB from/IN minced/JJ pork/NN and/CC prawns/NNS ./. Still/JJ worth/NN ordering/VBG if/IN you/PRP like/VB Ngor/NN Hiang/NN ./. We/PRP were/VBD recommended/IN the/DT chicken/NN wings/NNS by/IN the/DT waitress/NN who/WP took/VBD our/PRP$ order/NN ./. She/RB told/VBD us/PRP that/IN they/PRP are/VBP more/JJ like/IN the/DT Malaysian/JJ Style/NN chicken/NN wings/NN ./. It/PRP 's/POS alright/NN but/CC I/PRP would/MD n't/RB order/VB them/PRP again/RB as/IN they/PRP were/VBD a/DT little/JJ dry/JJ and/CC there/RB was/VBD nothing/NN special/JJ about/IN the/DT marinade/NN ./. The/DT good/JJ thing/NN about/IN You/PRP Huak/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT Lao/JJ Ban/NN Niang/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB much/JJ in/IN charge/NN of/IN the/DT kitchen/NN ./. So/CC the/DT dishes/NNS are/VBP a/DT little/JJ more/NN unique/NNS like/IN the/DT aforesaid/JJ White/NN Bee/NN Hoon/NN and/CC Fish/NNP Head/NNP with/IN Bittergourd/NN ./. Another/JJ dish/NN they/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB good/JJ here/RB is/VBZ the/DT leatherjacket/NN in/IN black/NN bean/NN sauce/NN ./. Being/VBG Teochew/NNP ,/, the/DT fish/NN is/VBZ always/RB fresh/JJ ,/, so/IN the/DT meat/NN is/VBZ nice/JJ and/CC delicate/JJ ./. The/DT black/NN bean/NN sauce/NN is/VBZ a/DT tad/NN on/IN the/DT salty/NN side/NN ,/, but/CC goes/VBZ very/RB well/RB with/IN rice/NN ./. Conclusion/NN I/PRP think/VB this/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ places/NNS up/IN North/NN that/WDT is/VBZ worth/JJ traveling/VBG for/IN !/. I/PRP must/VB admit/VB that/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB completely/VB sold/VBD on/IN the/DT White/JJ Bee/NN Hoon/NN ,/, but/CC that/WDT is/VBZ my/PRP$ opinion/NN against/IN hordes/NN of/IN loyal/NN followers/NN of/IN the/DT eatery/NN ./. The/DT sliced/VBN Fish/NNP Head/NNP with/IN Bittergourd/NN is/VBZ a/DT must/RB try/VB though/IN and/CC overall/NN ,/, its/PRP$ a/DT great/JJ Cze/NNP Char/NNP experience/NN ./. You/PRP Huak/VB Restaurant/NN 22/IN Jalan/NNP Tampang/NNP -LRB-/NNP Opp/NNP Sembawang/NNP Shopping/NNP Centre/NN -RRB-/IN Singapore/NNP 758966/NNP 98434699/NNP 11.30/NNP am/VBZ to/TO 10.30/VB pm/NN Closed/NN on/IN Wed/NNP </text>
