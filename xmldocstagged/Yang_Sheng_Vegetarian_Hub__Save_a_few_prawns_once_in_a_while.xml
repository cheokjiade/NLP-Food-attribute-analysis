<title>Yang Sheng Vegetarian Hub: Save a few prawns once in a while</title>
<text>I/PRP was/VBD walking/VBG along/IN the/DT row/NN of/IN shophouses/NN on/IN Macpherson/NNP Road/NNP looking/VBG for/IN this/DT shop/NN which/WDT my/PRP$ friend/NN brought/VBN me/PRP to/TO once/RB ,/, that/WDT sold/VBD this/DT really/RB yummy/JJ but/CC to/TO my/PRP$ surprise/JJ the/DT shop/NN is/VBZ now/RB under/IN new/JJ ownership/NN !/. My/PRP$ Coronary/JJ Clogging/NN Saturated/NN Fats/NN Restaurant/NN had/VBD repented/NN of/IN its/PRP$ sins/NN and/CC turned/VBD !/. Pasted/DT on/IN the/DT walls/NN were/VBD pictures/NN of/IN famous/JJ -LRB-/NN B/NN grade/NN -/: cos/NN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB them/PRP -RRB-/JJ people/NN posing/NN for/IN pictures/NN with/IN the/DT boss/NN of/IN the/DT stall/NN ./. What/WP clinched/VBZ the/DT deal/NN for/IN me/PRP was/VBD a/DT picture/NN of/IN our/PRP$ President/JJ Nathan/NN winking/NN and/CC giving/VBG a/DT thumbs/JJ up/NN !!/NN !/. Who/WP am/VBZ I/PRP to/TO argue/VB with/IN the/DT President/NN of/IN Singapore/NNP !/. The/DT first/JJ dish/NN was/VBD the/DT Cereal/NN ``/NN Prawns/NN ''/NN which/WRB was/VBD quite/RB good/JJ ./. The/DT cereal/NN was/VBD deep/JJ fried/VBD to/TO perfection/VB and/CC the/DT spices/NNS were/VBD done/VBN just/RB right/RB ./. The/DT ``/NNP Prawn/NNP ''/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ,/, and/CC tasted/VBD like/IN a/DT nice/JJ seafood/NN roll/NN ./. Great/JJ thing/NN was/VBD that/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VBN to/TO peel/NN off/IN the/DT shells/NN ./. I/PRP felt/VBD really/RB proud/JJ that/WDT because/IN of/IN my/PRP$ selfless/NN deed/NN ,/, 10/CD prawns/NNS were/VBD spared/RB a/DT gruesome/JJ death/NN that/IN day/NN !/. The/DT next/JJ animal/NN that/WDT we/PRP spared/VBD was/VBD the/DT Pig/NN ./. The/DT Sweet/NNP and/CC Sour/NNP Pork/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ./. The/DT sauce/NN was/VBD quite/RB standard/JJ ./. But/CC instead/RB of/IN the/DT usual/JJ bit/NN of/IN meat/NN coated/VBN with/IN a/DT thick/NN batter/NN ,/, the/DT ``/JJ pork/NN ''/NN did/VBD not/RB come/VB with/IN a/DT thick/JJ layer/NN of/IN flour/NN ./. The/DT ``/NN meat/NN ''/NN had/VBD a/DT chewy/JJ ,/, fibrous/JJ texture/NN and/CC was/VBD quite/RB tasty/JJ ./. OK/WP lah/PRP ,/, I/PRP guess/VBP I/PRP would/MD n't/RB mind/VB eating/VBG this/DT as/IN a/DT replacement/NN for/IN sweet/JJ and/CC sour/JJ pork/NN knowing/NN that/WDT there/EX is/VBZ no/DT cholesterol/NN in/IN the/DT dish/NN and/CC poor/NN was/VBD spared/RB !/. The/DT ``/NNP Cod/NNP Fish/NNP ''/NNP was/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT dissappointment/NN ./. The/DT fish/NN tasted/VBD like/IN a/DT good/JJ fish/NN cake/NN but/CC the/DT texture/NN was/VBD no/RB way/NN like/IN Cod/NNP ./. The/DT sauce/NN was/VBD alright/RB though/IN ./. I/PRP guess/VB if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB call/VBP it/PRP ``/NNP Cod/NNP ''/NNP ,/, it/PRP might/VB have/VB been/VBN alright/JJ ./. Tasted/NNS like/IN a/DT good/JJ tofu/NN fish/NN cake/NN drenched/VBD in/IN thick/NN soy/NN sauce/NN ./. Want/VBP to/TO go/VB healthy/JJ ?/. Might/JJ as/IN well/RB go/VB all/DT the/DT way/NN and/CC opt/NN for/IN the/DT unpolished/JJ brown/JJ rice/NN as/IN well/RB hor/NN !/. Conclusion/NN The/DT vegetarian/NN foods/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP taken/VBN so/RB far/JJ have/VBN been/VBN from/IN those/DT found/VBD in/IN food/NN courts/NN ./. I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN this/PRP is/VBZ much/JJ better/NN then/RB those/DT hawker/NN ones/NNS because/IN the/DT hawker/NN ones/NNS mostly/RB use/VB gluten/NN in/IN their/PRP$ mock/NN meats/NNS ./. The/DT ``/NN meats/NNS ''/RB here/RB can/MD be/VB differentiated/VBD ./. The/DT cooking/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ and/CC the/DT sauces/NNS were/VBD nice/JJ ./. I/PRP would/MD n't/RB mind/VB eating/VBG here/RB again/RB when/WRB I/PRP feel/VB the/DT need/NN to/TO lower/JJR my/PRP$ cholesterol/NN intake/NN ./. -LRB-/NNP T2/NNP .75/NNP +/NNP V2/NNP +/NNP S2/NNP +/NNP E1/NNP -RRB-/NNP Yang/NNP Sheng/NNP Vegetarian/NNP Hub/NNP 532/NNP ,/, Macpherson/NNP Road/NNP 67488900/NNP Bus/. 90/CD ,/, 62/NN ,/, 8/CD ,/, 151/NNP Open/NNP 9am/NN to/TO 9pm/VB </text>
