<title>Hokkaido Sushi: The Sake lovin' Chef is Back!</title>
<text>My/PRP$ Japanese/JJ friend/NN Yukari/NN has/VBZ some/JJ relatives/NN living/NN in/IN Sendai/NN ./. Thankfully/IN they/PRP have/VBP survived/VBN the/DT Tsunami/NN although/RB a/DT large/JJ part/NN of/IN Sendai/PRP had/VBD been/VBN destroyed/VBG ./. She/RB told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT the/DT Japanese/NN people/NNS are/VBP grateful/JJ for/IN the/DT support/NN that/IN the/DT international/NN community/NN is/VBZ rendering/JJ to/TO Japan/NNP and/CC while/IN they/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO rebuild/VB the/DT country/NN ,/, they/PRP want/VB us/PRP to/TO continue/VB to/TO support/VB their/PRP$ economy/NN by/IN continuing/NN to/TO buy/VB their/PRP$ seafood/NN and/CC produce/NN ./. Her/NN husband/NN ,/, Shinji/NN who/WP imports/VBZ seafood/NN from/IN Tsukiji/NNP tells/VBZ me/PRP that/IN some/NN of/IN his/PRP$ suppliers/NN have/VBZ indeed/RB lost/JJ contact/NN with/IN some/NN of/IN the/DT fishermen/NN ./. However/RB ,/, the/DT people/NN at/IN Tsukiji/NNP are/VBP trying/VBG their/PRP$ best/JJS to/TO continue/VB to/TO supply/NN seafood/NN ./. They/PRP are/VBP refusing/JJ to/TO give/VB up/RP at/IN a/DT time/NN like/IN this/DT and/CC they/PRP need/VBP our/JJ support/NN ./. I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/WDT we/PRP all/RB are/VBP concerned/JJ about/IN radiation/NN contamination/NN of/IN the/DT seafood/NN and/CC produce/NN ./. Shinji/DT tells/VBZ me/PRP that/WDT each/JJ shipment/NN of/IN fish/NN that/IN he/PRP imports/VBZ now/RB has/VBZ to/TO undergo/VB special/JJ inspection/NN for/IN radiation/NN contamination/NN ./. Apart/JJ from/IN that/WDT ,/, Chef/NN Thomas/NN also/RB told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT he/PRP is/VBZ also/RB importing/JJ seafood/NN from/IN other/JJ parts/NNS of/IN Japan/NNP that/WDT are/VBP not/RB affected/VB by/IN radiation/NN ./. So/RB with/IN all/DT the/DT safeguards/NN in/IN place/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP quite/RB confident/JJ that/IN the/DT food/NN at/IN the/DT Japanese/NN restaurants/NNS are/VBP safe/JJ ./. Back/VBN in/IN 2009/NN ,/, Hokkaido/NN Sushi/NN was/VBD voted/JJ Best/NN Japanese/NN Restaurant/NN when/WRB they/PRP were/VBD barely/RB opened/VBD for/IN six/CD months/NNS ./. I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN wanting/VBG to/TO pay/VB them/PRP a/DT visit/NN ,/, but/CC never/RB got/VBD round/NN to/TO it/PRP ./. So/RB when/WRB I/PRP finally/RB decided/VBD to/TO visit/VB recently/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD amazed/JJ to/TO find/VB that/IN the/DT reviews/NNS on/IN the/DT restaurant/NN has/VBZ been/VBN rather/RB lack/JJ lustre/NN over/IN the/DT last/JJ year/NN or/CC so/RB ./. You/PRP might/VB have/VB felt/VBD the/DT same/JJ way/NN if/IN you/PRP had/VBD visited/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./. So/RB what/WP happened/VBD ?/. I/PRP met/VBD up/RP with/IN Chef/NN Thomas/NN ,/, who/WP was/VBD helming/IN the/DT restaurant/NN when/WRB it/PRP first/RB opened/VBD in/IN 2009/NN ./. He/PRP told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT right/JJ after/IN the/DT restaurant/NN won/IN the/DT award/NN ,/, he/PRP left/VBN to/TO run/VB another/DT of/IN his/PRP$ restaurants/NN in/IN Vietnam/NN ./. During/IN his/PRP$ absence/NN ,/, Hokkaido/NNP Sushi/NNP began/VBD to/TO falter/VB and/CC so/RB after/IN two/CD years/NNS ,/, he/PRP has/VBZ returned/VBN to/TO take/VB over/IN management/NN of/IN Hokkaido/NN Sushi/NN recently/RB ./. Nowadays/RB I/PRP divide/VBD Sushi/NN restaurants/NN into/IN two/CD different/JJ types/NN ./. The/DT ones/NNS which/WDT I/PRP go/VB eat/VB with/IN my/PRP$ kids/NNS for/IN fun/NN and/CC those/RB which/WRB I/PRP leave/VB the/DT kids/NNS at/IN home/NN so/IN that/WDT I/PRP can/MD have/VB a/DT serious/JJ Sushi/NN experience/NN ./. Whenever/. I/PRP go/VB out/VB for/IN family/NN Sushi/NN ,/, I/PRP find/VB myself/PRP eating/VBG stuff/NN like/IN inari/NNP -LRB-/NNP bean/NN curd/NN skin/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC soft/JJ shell/NN crab/NN rolls/NN ./. The/DT kids/NNS enjoy/VB the/DT conveyor/JJ belt/NN experience/NN but/CC I/PRP seldom/VB touch/VB the/DT raw/JJ fish/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD the/DT sushi/NN belt/NN that/IN kept/NN me/PRP away/RB from/IN sushi/JJ for/IN so/RB long/JJ ./. I/PRP only/RB got/VBD to/TO like/VB raw/JJ fish/NN after/IN I/PRP ate/VBD Sushi/NN at/IN a/DT Sushi/NN bar/NN ./. In/IN all/DT honesty/NN ,/, I/PRP still/RB think/VB a/DT nice/JJ fishhead/NN steamboat/NN or/CC steamed/JJ pomfret/NN has/VBZ got/VBN more/RB ``/JJ shiok/NN ''/NN in/IN it/PRP then/RB eating/VBG raw/JJ fish/NN ./. However/RB ,/, what/WP I/PRP do/VB enjoy/VB about/IN Sushi/NN is/VBZ learning/VBG to/TO appreciate/VB the/DT nuances/JJ and/CC textural/JJ differences/NN between/IN different/JJ seafood/NN species/NN ./. As/IN opposed/NN to/TO wolfing/VB down/VB a/DT whole/JJ plate/NN of/IN fish/NN ,/, when/WRB you/PRP have/VB to/TO focus/VB your/PRP$ entire/JJ attention/NN on/IN one/CD mouthful/NN of/IN fish/NN ,/, it/PRP really/RB does/VB sharpen/IN your/PRP$ taste/NN buds/NN ./. The/DT Sushi/NN Omakase/NN course/NN here/RB starts/VBZ with/IN a/DT salad/NN ,/, followed/NN by/IN three/CD types/NNS of/IN appetizers/NN ./. We/PRP were/VBD given/VBN some/DT dried/JJ leatherjacket/NN ,/, dried/JJ fugu/NN and/CC this/DT very/RB interesting/JJ egg/NN omelette/NNS where/WRB they/PRP white/JJ is/VBZ first/JJ separated/NN from/IN the/DT yolk/NN ,/, done/VBN tamago/JJ yaki/NN -LRB-/NN rolled/VBD omelette/RB -RRB-/JJ style/NN and/CC then/RB the/DT yolks/NN were/VBD steamed/JJ and/CC crumbled/JJ on/IN top/JJ ./. Tastes/NNS like/IN hard/JJ boiled/NN egg/NN except/NN that/IN the/DT white/JJ is/VBZ sweet/JJ ,/, fluffy/JJ and/CC tender/JJ ./. It/PRP 's/POS amazing/NN new/JJ take/VB on/IN the/DT humble/JJ egg/NN ./. After/IN the/DT appetizer/NN comes/VBZ the/DT sashimi/JJ course/NN and/CC we/PRP were/VBD presented/VBD with/IN Sayori/NN or/CC halfbeak/NN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT fish/NN that/WDT comes/VBZ into/IN season/NN at/IN springtime/NN ./. This/DT little/JJ fish/NN looks/VBZ like/IN something/NN I/PRP would/MD catch/VB in/IN order/NN to/TO put/VB on/IN a/DT hook/NN to/TO catch/VB bigger/JJR fish/NN ./. But/CC after/IN tasting/VBG it/PRP ,/, I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP might/VB keep/VB it/PRP for/IN myself/PRP next/JJ time/NN ./. Eaten/JJ with/IN freshly/JJ grated/NN young/JJ ginger/NN and/CC shallots/NN ,/, it/PRP tasted/VBD almost/RB like/IN chicken/NN rice/NN .../: seriously/RB ./. It/PRP 's/POS amazing/NN how/RB the/DT ginger/NN brought/VBN out/IN the/DT savoury/NN tones/NN of/IN the/DT fish/NN which/WDT would/MD be/VB missing/VBD if/IN you/PRP omit/VB the/DT ginger/NN ./. Definitely/DT something/NN I/PRP would/MD order/VB again/RB ./. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD After/IN the/DT sashimi/NN course/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD presented/VBD with/IN 15/CD different/JJ types/NN of/IN Sushi/NN ./. We/PRP had/VBD the/DT usual/JJ suspects/NN of/IN Kanpachi/NNP -LRB-/NNP Greater/NNP Amberjack/NNP -RRB-/NNP ,/, Shima/NNP aji/NNP -LRB-/NNP striped/NNP jack/NNP -RRB-/NNP ,/, maguro/NNP -LRB-/NNP tuna/NNP -RRB-/NNP and/CC Uni/NNP -LRB-/NNP sea/NNP urchin/NNP -RRB-/NNP etc./NNP ./. They/PRP were/VBD all/DT very/RB fresh/JJ and/CC I/PRP plan/VBD to/TO write/VB a/DT separate/JJ series/NN of/IN blog/NN posts/NNS on/IN them/PRP ./. For/IN now/RB I/PRP shall/MD just/RB highlight/VB a/DT few/JJ of/IN the/DT more/JJ interesting/JJ ones/NNS we/PRP had/VBD that/IN night/NN ./. Part/DT of/IN the/DT fun/NN of/IN sitting/VBG at/IN the/DT Sushi/NNP Bar/NNP is/VBZ the/DT interaction/NN between/IN you/PRP and/CC the/DT Itamae/JJ -LRB-/NN Sushi/NN Chef/NN -RRB-/NN ./. In/IN fact/NN ,/, most/NN Sushi/NN aficionados/NN probably/RB have/VBN favorite/JJ places/NNS they/PRP go/VB to/TO ,/, not/RB just/RB because/IN the/DT sushi/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, but/CC more/JJ because/IN they/PRP are/VBP familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT Itamae/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ of/IN course/NN a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT problem/NN if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB speak/VB the/DT same/JJ language/NN as/IN the/DT Itamae/NN ./. At/IN Hokkaido/NN Sushi/NN ,/, you/PRP wo/MD n't/RB have/VB the/DT same/JJ problem/NN since/IN both/DT Chef/NN Thomas/NN and/CC Patrick/NN can/MD speak/VB Hokkien/VBD to/TO you/PRP if/IN you/PRP like/VB ./. So/RB eating/VBG at/IN the/DT bar/NN is/VBZ quite/RB relaxing/JJ as/IN you/PRP can/MD banter/VB with/IN the/DT chefs/NN and/CC Chef/NN Thomas/NN in/IN particular/JJ ,/, especially/RB adapt/JJ at/IN livening/JJ things/NNS up/IN ./. One/CD of/IN the/DT things/NN he/PRP did/VBD was/VBD to/TO slam/VB this/DT piece/NN of/IN Tako/NNP -LRB-/NNP Octopus/NNP -RRB-/NNP onto/IN his/PRP$ chopping/NN board/NN to/TO show/VB us/PRP that/WDT it/PRP was/VBD still/RB ``/JJ alive/NN ''/NN ./. He/PRP told/VBD us/PRP that/WDT when/WRB you/PRP cut/VB off/IN the/DT tentacles/NN of/IN the/DT Octopus/NN ,/, they/PRP will/MD actually/RB still/RB be/VB squirming/NN around/IN for/IN a/DT pretty/JJ long/JJ time/NN ./. He/PRP served/VBD the/DT Tako/NN atop/IN the/DT rice/NN with/IN some/JJ lemon/NN juice/NN on/IN top/JJ ./. I/PRP have/VBP never/RB had/VBD fresh/JJ octopus/NNS before/IN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD amazing/JJ how/RB sweet/JJ it/PRP was/VBD !/. Normally/NNP Tako/NNP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB served/VBD cooked/VBN because/IN of/IN the/DT risk/NN of/IN parasites/NNS ./. But/CC Chef/NNP Thomas/NNP told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT you/PRP can/MD eat/VB it/PRP raw/JJ if/IN you/PRP remove/VB the/DT suckers/NN ./. -LRB-/WP I/PRP am/VBP still/RB ok/JJ as/IN at/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN this/DT writing/VBG -RRB-/. I/PRP have/VBP always/RB found/VBN cooked/VBN Saba/NNP -LRB-/NNP Japanese/NNP Mackeral/NNP -RRB-/NNP a/DT bit/NN too/RB fishy/JJ for/IN my/PRP$ liking/VBG ,/, so/RB when/WRB Chef/NN Thomas/NN told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT he/PRP was/VBD giving/VBG me/PRP Nama/VB -LRB-/VB fresh/JJ -RRB-/NN Saba/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD a/DT little/JJ apprehensive/NN ./. But/CC as/IN it/PRP turned/VBD out/JJ ,/, fresh/JJ Saba/NN was/VBD actually/RB pleasantly/JJ sweet/JJ and/CC not/RB as/IN fishy/JJ as/IN the/DT cooked/VBN version/NN ./. This/DT tane/JJ -LRB-/NN topping/NN -RRB-/NN is/VBZ always/RB served/VBD with/IN a/DT sliver/NN of/IN the/DT bluish/JJ skin/NN with/IN wavy/JJ black/NN lines/NN so/RB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ easily/RB identified/JJ ./. It/PRP must/VB be/VB noted/VBD that/IN Saba/NN spoils/NN quickly/RB and/CC must/VB be/VB eaten/VBD super/RB fresh/JJ or/CC it/PRP might/VB result/NN in/IN scombroid/NNP poisoning/NNP ./. Not/RB bad/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP will/VB have/VB to/TO eat/VB this/DT a/DT couple/NN more/NN times/NNS before/IN I/PRP can/MD rate/NN it/PRP ./. Anago/NNP -LRB-/NNP Conger/NNP Eel/NNP -RRB-/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT first/JJ sushi/NN that/WDT I/PRP actually/RB liked/VBD ./. Being/VBG a/DT cooked/VBN dish/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ Sushi/NN to/TO try/VB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP new/JJ to/TO it/PRP ./. But/CC you/PRP should/MD never/RB ask/VB for/IN Anago/DT first/JJ because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT fish/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN braised/VBN in/IN shoyu/NN ,/, so/RB if/IN you/PRP have/VBP it/PRP at/IN the/DT beginning/VBG of/IN your/PRP$ sushi/NN course/NN ,/, it/PRP will/MD dull/VB your/PRP$ tastebuds/NNS to/TO the/DT the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT raw/JJ items/NNS ./. It/PRP is/VBZ usually/RB given/VBN towards/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT course/NN ./. The/DT key/NN to/TO anago/VB is/VBZ the/DT texture/NN ./. One/PRP that/WDT is/VBZ done/VBN well/RB should/VB be/VB tender/JJ and/CC creamy/JJ ./. Chef/NNP Thomas/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN known/VBN to/TO be/VB rather/RB generous/JJ with/IN his/PRP$ anago/NN ./. The/DT photo/NN shown/NN here/RB is/VBZ exceptionally/RB generous/JJ because/IN we/PRP were/VBD quite/RB full/JJ already/RB so/RB instead/RB of/IN two/CD portions/NNS of/IN rice/NN ,/, he/PRP reduced/VBZ it/PRP to/TO one/CD with/IN the/DT same/JJ amount/NN of/IN topping/NN ./. The/DT taste/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ and/CC the/DT flesh/NN is/VBZ tender/JJ and/CC creamy/JJ ./. Definitely/RB an/DT item/NN you/PRP should/MD ask/VB for/IN ./. Most/JJS King/NNP Crab/NNP is/VBZ steamed/JJ first/JJ and/CC served/VBD cold/JJ ./. Chef/NNP Thomas/NNP perfers/NN to/TO grill/VB it/PRP instead/RB and/CC so/RB even/RB though/IN the/DT flesh/NN has/VBZ contracted/JJ somewhat/NN ,/, the/DT slight/JJ smokey/JJ aroma/NN together/RB with/IN the/DT sweet/JJ warm/JJ flesh/NN really/RB brought/VBN out/IN the/DT best/JJS in/IN the/DT King/NNP Crab/NNP ./. So/RB simple/JJ ,/, yet/RB so/RB good/JJ ./. The/DT Sushi/NN course/NN ends/VBZ with/IN something/NN warm/JJ and/CC savoury/JJ ./. In/IN our/PRP$ case/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD given/VBN some/NN beef/NN and/CC shitake/NN mushroom/NN in/IN teriyaki/NN sauce/NN ./. A/DT nice/JJ way/NN to/TO provide/VB some/DT contrast/NN to/TO all/PDT the/DT raw/JJ food/NN and/CC to/TO finish/VB the/DT meal/NN with/IN something/NN that/WDT will/MD take/VB care/NN of/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN something/NN warm/JJ and/CC savoury/JJ ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ good/JJ ,/, but/CC nothing/NN unexpected/JJ ./. Conclusion/NN Part/NN of/IN the/DT fun/NN of/IN eating/VBG at/IN the/DT bar/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO interact/VB with/IN the/DT itamae/NN and/CC I/PRP think/VB that/WDT you/PRP will/VB find/VB it/PRP very/RB comfortable/VBD sitting/VBG at/IN the/DT bar/NN here/RB ./. They/PRP serve/VB excellent/JJ sushi/NN at/IN quite/RB an/DT affordable/JJ price/NN compared/VBD to/TO other/JJ Sushi/NN bars/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP have/VBP been/VBN enjoying/VBG Sushi/NN at/IN the/DT conveyor/NN belt/NN and/CC feel/VB that/IN its/PRP$ time/NN to/TO move/VB up/RP to/TO the/DT Sushi/NNP Bar/NNP ,/, then/RB Hokkaido/JJ Sushi/NN is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO start/VB and/CC Chef/NN Thomas/NN has/VBZ come/VBN up/IN with/IN some/DT very/RB special/JJ sets/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ readers/NNS ./. 1/CD ./. Special/JJ ieat/NNP Lunch/NNP Set/NNP :/: $/$ 38/CD +/NN +/NN for/IN salad/NN ,/, 5/CD pieces/NN sashimi/NN ,/, hotate/NN tempura/NN ,/, 9/LS pieces/NN Sushi/NN and/CC 2/CD Spicy/NN Maki/NN ,/, Agadashi/NN miso/NN soup/NN ,/, Choice/NN of/IN coffee/NN or/CC ice/NN cream/NN ./.
