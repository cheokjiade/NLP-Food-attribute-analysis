<title>Hajjah Meriam Family Stall: Has Anyone tried this Kentang Ball?</title>
<text>Now/RB this/DT is/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ dish/NN ./. I/PRP have/VB never/RB eaten/VBD this/DT before/RB so/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB a/DT gold/JJ standard/JJ to/TO compare/VB it/PRP to/TO ./. Maybe/DT our/JJ readers/NNS can/MD shed/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN light/NN on/IN where/WRB the/DT really/RB good/JJ ones/NNS are/VBP ?/. Anyway/RB ,/, the/DT dish/NN consists/NN of/IN mashed/NN potato/NN about/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN a/DT cricket/JJ ball/NN filled/VBD with/IN minced/NN beef/NN inside/NN ./. The/DT whole/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ deep/JJ fried/VBD in/IN a/DT batter/NN and/CC then/RB served/VBD in/IN a/DT bowl/NN of/IN spicy/JJ chicken/NN soup/NN ./. Something/DT new/JJ for/IN me/PRP ./. The/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT dish/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB predictable/JJ ./. Imagine/JJ eating/NN mashed/NN potato/NN and/CC minced/NN beef/NN and/CC essentially/RB you/PRP have/VB it/PRP ./. Certainly/JJ worth/NN a/DT try/VB if/IN you/PRP have/VBP n't/RB had/VBD it/PRP before/RB ./. After/IN my/PRP$ recent/JJ disappointment/NN with/IN the/DT famous/JJ Roti/NN John/NN at/IN Serangoon/NNP Way/NNP FC/NNP ,/, I/PRP was/VBD understandably/JJ apprehensive/NN about/IN Roti/NN John/NN ,/, not/RB wanting/VBG to/TO have/VB to/TO grieve/VB all/DT over/RB again/RB so/IN soon/NN after/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ tragedy/NN ./. But/CC thankfully/RB ,/, my/PRP$ faith/NN in/IN the/DT good/JJ old/JJ Roti/NN John/NN has/VB been/VB restored/RB by/IN the/DT one/CD served/VBD here/RB ./. The/DT crust/NN was/VBD toasted/JJ till/NN it/PRP was/VBD light/JJ and/CC crispy/JJ and/CC the/DT savoury/JJ minced/NN mutton/NN in/IN the/DT omelette/NN was/VBD adequately/RB spiced/JJ and/CC delicious/JJ ./. They/PRP also/RB serve/VB it/PRP was/VBD a/DT great/JJ homemade/NN sweet/JJ chilli/NN sauce/NN ./. Always/JJ delighted/NN to/TO try/VB something/NN new/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB have/VB a/DT craving/NN for/IN the/DT Kentang/JJ Ball/NN anytime/NN soon/NN ./. The/DT Roti/NN John/NN is/VBZ definitely/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT better/NN ones/NNS around/IN ./. </text>
