<title>A Taste of The Best: Singapore's First Photo Exhibition of "Street" Food Photography!</title>
<text>Back/VBN in/IN 2011/NNP ,/, CNN/NNP ran/NNP a/DT story/NN about/IN the/DT food/NN photography/NN workshop/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN running/RB since/IN 2008/CD ./. It/PRP would/MD seem/VB that/IN Singapore/NN is/VBZ not/RB only/RB crazy/JJ about/IN food/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB about/IN food/NN photography/NN as/IN well/RB ./. The/DT genre/NN of/IN casual/JJ food/NN photography/NN or/CC what/WP I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO call/VBP ``/NNP Street/NNP ''/NNP Food/NNP Photography/NN is/VBZ surely/JJ but/CC steadily/RB gaining/VBG recognition/NN by/IN the/DT wider/JJ photographic/NN community/NN ./. This/DT exhibition/NN is/VBZ just/RB a/DT natural/JJ progression/NN of/IN the/DT phenomenon/NN that/WDT is/VBZ now/RB a/DT favorite/JJ activity/NN of/IN millions/NN around/IN the/DT world/NN ./. I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO make/VB this/DT first/JJ exhibition/NN a/DT little/JJ more/JJ special/JJ by/IN including/VBG the/DT element/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN dioramas/NN ./. These/DT are/VBP plastic/JJ models/NN of/IN familiar/JJ local/NN food/NN which/WDT we/PRP have/VBN placed/VBN in/IN a/DT fixed/JJ setting/NN ./. The/DT reasons/NN I/PRP made/VBD these/DT dioramas/NNS are/VBP twofold/JJ ./. First/JJ ,/, I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO use/VB them/PRP as/IN teaching/JJ aids/NN for/IN our/PRP$ photography/JJ workshops/NN ./. By/CC fixing/IN the/DT setting/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN models/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD get/VB our/PRP$ students/NN to/TO focus/VB on/IN just/RB two/CD elements/NNS of/IN food/NN photography/NN ,/, viz/NNP the/DT composition/NN and/CC lighting/NN ./. The/DT second/NN reason/NN is/VBZ that/IN I/PRP came/VBD across/IN this/DT guy/NN who/WP is/VBZ pioneering/RB the/DT making/VBG models/NN of/IN local/NN food/NN and/CC I/PRP really/RB wanted/VBD to/TO see/VB what/WP he/PRP can/MD do/VB with/IN Kaya/NN Toast/NN and/CC Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP ./. In/IN order/NN to/TO create/VB these/DT models/NN ,/, we/PRP had/VBD to/TO get/VB hold/NN of/IN real/JJ food/NN from/IN some/NN of/IN our/PRP$ favorite/JJ food/NN stalls/NNS here/RB and/CC send/VB them/PRP overseas/VB for/IN the/DT molds/NN to/TO be/VB made/VBD ./. Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP aficionados/NNP may/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO tell/VB straightaway/NN that/IN our/JJ pork/NN ribs/NNS were/VBD taken/VBN from/IN Song/NNP Fa/NNP Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP ./. To/RB get/VB the/DT molds/NN done/VBN ,/, we/PRP got/VBD a/DT bowl/NN of/IN Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP ,/, shrink/NNP wrapped/IN the/DT pork/NN ribs/NNS individually/VBD and/CC got/VBD them/PRP airflown/VBD to/TO the/DT workshop/NN !/. The/DT photos/NNS on/IN the/DT left/JJ were/VBD the/DT pictures/NN I/PRP showed/VBD to/TO Phil/VB Designs/NN as/IN examples/NN of/IN the/DT photos/NNS I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO shoot/VB with/IN the/DT models/NN ./. I/PRP think/VBP you/PRP will/VB agree/VB that/IN they/PRP are/VBP excellent/JJ ./. These/DT models/NNS are/VBP now/RB on/IN display/VB at/IN Millenia/NNP Walk/NNP ./. The/DT purpose/NN of/IN putting/NN them/PRP there/RB is/VBZ so/RB that/RB budding/IN the/DT food/NN photographer/NN can/MD try/VB their/PRP$ hand/NN at/IN taking/VBG a/DT photo/NN to/TO match/VB the/DT one/CD I/PRP took/VBD ./. In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, I/PRP hope/VBD to/TO that/WDT they/PRP can/MD pick/VB up/IN a/DT few/JJ tips/NNS on/IN composition/NN and/CC lighting/NN ./. This/DT exhibition/NN is/VBZ for/IN anyone/PRP who/WP is/VBZ interested/RB in/IN food/NN photography/NN !/. So/RB do/VB come/VB by/IN and/CC try/VB your/PRP$ hand/NN at/IN taking/VBG photos/NNS of/IN the/DT models/NN !/. There/EX is/VBZ also/RB a/DT food/NN photography/NN contest/NNS where/WRB you/PRP can/MD submit/VB your/PRP$ photos/NNS and/CC get/VB them/PRP printed/VB on/IN the/DT spot/NN ./. See/VB you/PRP there/RB !/.
