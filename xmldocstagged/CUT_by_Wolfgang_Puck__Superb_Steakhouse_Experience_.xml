<title>CUT by Wolfgang Puck: Superb Steakhouse Experience!</title>
<text>Anyone/RB who/WP has/VBZ been/VBN to/TO the/DT US/NNP would/MD know/VB what/WP a/DT typical/JJ American/NN Steakhouse/NN is/VBZ like/IN ./. Dark/JJ wood/NN furniture/NN ,/, heavy/NN steak/NN knives/NN ,/, charred/NN steaks/NNS typically/RB served/VBD with/IN creamed/NN spinach/NN and/CC thick/NN cut/NN fries/NNS ,/, Maryland/NN crabcakes/NN for/IN starters/NN and/CC Caesar/NN Salads/NN tossed/NN at/IN your/PRP$ table/NN ./. Well/RB ,/, the/DT modern/NN Steakhouses/NN seem/NN to/TO be/VB changing/JJ all/NN that/WDT ./. I/PRP just/RB returned/RB from/IN Chicago/NN ,/, where/WRB I/PRP had/VBD the/DT 55/NN day/NN dry/JJ aged/NN USDA/NN prime/JJ ribeye/NN steak/NN at/IN Dave/NNP Burg/NNP 's/POS Primehouse/NN ./. This/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ relatively/RB new/JJ in/IN Chicago/NN ,/, but/CC in/IN three/CD short/NN years/NNS ,/, it/PRP had/VBD risen/RB the/DT ranks/VBZ and/CC overtaken/VB the/DT more/JJ established/JJ steakhouses/NN to/TO become/VBN one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ Steakhouses/NN there/RB ./. It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/WDT these/DT modern/NN Steakhouses/NNS are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO fuse/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN fine/JJ dining/NN into/IN the/DT classic/JJ Steakhouse/NN concept/NN ./. The/DT steak/NN is/VBZ still/RB presented/VBD bare/NN naked/NN on/IN a/DT plate/NN ,/, but/CC before/IN that/WDT ,/, you/PRP get/VB teased/VB by/IN an/DT amuse-bouche/NN instead/RB of/IN crabcakes/NN and/CC you/PRP might/VB finish/VB your/PRP$ meal/NN with/IN a/DT 20/CD year/NN old/JJ Pu/NN Erh/NN Tea/NN instead/RB of/IN coffee/NN ./. Cut/DT is/VBZ pretty/RB much/JJ the/DT same/JJ concept/NN ./. The/DT appetizer/NN menu/NN is/VBZ as/IN fancy/NN as/IN any/DT fine/JJ dining/NN establishment/NN but/CC the/DT limelight/NN is/VBZ never/RB taken/VBN off/IN their/PRP$ impressive/NN list/NN of/IN cow/NN cuts/NNS from/IN the/DT best/JJ ranches/NN around/IN the/DT world/NN ./. We/PRP were/VBD told/JJ that/IN the/DT Nantucket/NN Bay/NN Scallops/RB have/VBN just/RB come/VB into/IN season/NN and/CC so/RB the/DT chef/NN pan/NN seared/VBD some/JJ for/IN us/PRP$ with/IN a/DT slightly/RB tangy/JJ butter/NN emulsion/NN ./. This/DT was/VBD the/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP have/VBP encountered/VBN these/DT smallish/JJ scallops/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD n't/RB have/VB believed/JJ Adam/NN -LRB-/. The/DT General/NNP Manager/NNP -RRB-/NNP when/WRB he/PRP told/VBD us/PRP that/IN they/PRP were/VBD sweet/JJ as/IN candy/JJ until/IN I/PRP actually/RB tasted/VBD them/PRP ./. They/PRP were/VBD quite/RB simply/JJ the/DT best/JJ scallops/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB come/VB across/IN !/. Chef/NN had/VBD lightly/RB seared/VBD them/PRP so/RB that/IN they/PRP were/VBD still/RB pretty/JJ much/JJ raw/JJ inside/NN and/CC the/DT sweetness/NN of/IN the/DT scallops/NN was/VBD delicately/RB balanced/VBN with/IN the/DT ume/JJ infused/NN butter/NN emulsion/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD one/CD of/IN those/DT dishes/NNS which/WRB you/PRP wish/VBP would/MD never/RB end/VB ./. Bone/JJ Marrow/NN is/VBZ the/DT in/IN thing/NN nowadays/RB and/CC most/JJ places/NNS serve/VB it/PRP by/IN simply/NN grilling/IN it/PRP and/CC pairing/VB it/PRP with/IN toast/NN ./. What/WP CUT/PRP has/VBZ done/VBN with/IN their/PRP$ bone/NN marrow/NN dish/NN instead/RB ,/, was/VBD to/TO incorporate/VB the/DT marrow/NN with/IN eggs/NN and/CC milk/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT custard/NN which/WDT is/VBZ then/RB stuffed/JJ back/RB into/IN the/DT bone/NN ./. The/DT resulting/NN ``/NN Flan/NN ''/NN tastes/VBZ like/IN a/DT marrow/JJ flavored/NN creme/NN caramel/NN !/. Paired/JJ with/IN mushroom/JJ marmalade/NN on/IN slice/NN of/IN toasted/NN Brioche/NN ,/, this/DT was/VBD yet/RB another/JJ dish/NN that/WDT hits/VBZ all/RB the/DT right/JJ receptors/NN on/IN the/DT palate/NN ./. But/CC of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT stars/NN of/IN the/DT evening/NN were/VBD the/DT steaks/NNS and/CC I/PRP guess/VB the/DT question/NN on/IN everyone/NNP 's/POS mind/NN is/VBZ whether/CC CUT/PRP is/VBZ worth/IN its/PRP$ ``/JJ Celebrity/NN Restaurant/NN ''/NN tag/NN ?/. Everyone/DT knows/NN that/IN the/DT most/NN important/JJ thing/NN about/IN a/DT steak/NN is/VBZ the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT meat/NN itself/PRP ./. With/IN a/DT good/JJ piece/NN of/IN meat/NN and/CC a/DT few/JJ simple/JJ tips/NN ,/, anyone/PRP can/MD make/VB a/DT good/JJ steak/NN at/IN home/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP interested/JJ cooking/NN your/PRP$ own/JJ steaks/NNS ,/, do/VB check/VB out/IN my/PRP$ Video/NN Blog/NN on/IN how/RB to/TO cook/VB a/DT steak/NN !/. So/CC why/WRB go/VB to/TO a/DT restaurant/NN to/TO eat/VB a/DT steak/NN ,/, especially/RB when/WRB you/PRP can/MD easily/RB get/VB really/RB good/JJ cuts/NNS of/IN meats/NNS from/IN specialty/NN butchers/NNS nowadays/RB ?/. Well/RB in/IN short/NN ,/, you/PRP pay/VB to/TO elevate/VB your/PRP$ steak/NN from/IN good/JJ to/TO great/JJ ./. Of/IN the/DT different/JJ sirloins/NN we/PRP tasted/VBD ,/, the/DT US/NNP Kobe/NNP from/IN Snake/NNP River/NNP Farms/NNP was/VBD my/PRP$ personal/JJ favorite/NN ./. It/PRP had/VBD a/DT luxurious/JJ buttery/JJ texture/NN with/IN an/DT intense/JJ beefy/NN aroma/NN ./. US/NNP Kobe/NNP is/VBZ a/DT cross/NN between/IN Japanese/NNP Wagyu/NNP and/CC the/DT Black/NNP Angus/NNP which/WDT explains/VBZ the/DT enhanced/NN marbling/VBG while/NN still/RB having/VBG that/WDT characteristic/NN beefiness/NN of/IN US/NNP beef/NN ./. The/DT Japanese/NNP Wagyu/NNP from/IN Shiga/NNP prefecture/NNP was/VBD a/DT different/JJ kettle/NN of/IN ,/, errrr/NNP .../: cattle/NNS ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT full/JJ blooded/NN Wagyu/NN and/CC so/RB it/PRP had/VBD the/DT characteristic/NN intense/NN marbling/VBG with/IN a/DT lightly/JJ scented/NN and/CC delicate/NN beefiness/NN ./. With/IN each/JJ bite/VB you/PRP are/VBP rewarded/JJ with/IN an/DT explosion/NN of/IN creamy/JJ juiciness/NN but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB a/DT steak/NN which/WRB you/PRP can/MD eat/VB in/IN large/JJ portions/NNS as/IN the/DT enjoyment/NN intensifies/NN and/CC plateaus/NN way/NN too/RB quickly/RB ./. My/PRP$ personal/JJ preference/NN is/VBZ still/RB to/TO have/VB Japanese/NNP Wagyu/NNP sliced/VBN thin/JJ and/CC served/VBD as/IN shabu/JJ shabu/NN ./. The/DT USDA/NNP Prime/NNP 21/NNP day/NN aged/NN beef/NN was/VBD also/RB good/JJ by/IN itself/PRP but/CC when/WRB you/PRP eat/VB it/PRP side/NN by/IN side/NN with/IN the/DT US/NNP Kobe/NNP ,/, the/DT difference/NN in/IN taste/NN and/CC texture/NN is/VBZ stark/RB ./. Local/JJ steak/NN lovers/NNS might/VB immediately/RB think/VB ,/, ``/RB Hey/UH ,/, I/PRP could/MD get/VB hold/NN of/IN Snake/NNP River/NNP Farm/NNP US/NNP Kobe/NNP from/IN that/WDT little/JJ outlet/NN at/IN the/DT basement/NN of/IN Central/NN ,/, so/RB what/WP 's/POS the/DT big/JJ deal/NN ?/. ''/CC Well/RB ,/, the/DT big/JJ deal/NN is/VBZ that/IN Snake/NN River/NN Farms/RB have/VBN different/JJ grades/NNS of/IN Kobe/NN and/CC CUT/NN has/VBZ a/DT special/JJ arrangement/NN with/IN them/PRP such/JJ that/IN they/PRP have/VBP first/JJ pick/NN of/IN their/PRP$ Gold/NN grade/NN beef/NN for/IN their/PRP$ three/CD restaurants/NNS in/IN the/DT US/NNP and/CC Singapore/NNP ./. So/RB that/IN steak/NN represents/IN the/DT cream/NN of/IN their/PRP$ cattle/NNS crop/RB !/. The/DT other/JJ thing/NN we/PRP ca/MD n't/RB do/VB at/IN home/NN is/VBZ that/IN elusive/NNP char/NNP on/IN the/DT outside/NN of/IN the/DT steak/NN ./. Much/RB has/VB been/VBN said/JJ about/IN the/DT current/JJ trend/NN of/IN a/DT perfectly/JJ pink-all-the-way-through/NN Sous/NN Vide/NN steak/NN ,/, but/CC for/IN me/PRP a/DT steak/NN still/RB needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB cooked/VBN at/IN high/JJ heat/NN to/TO bring/VB out/IN its/PRP$ full/JJ flavor/NN ./. A/DT Sous/JJ Vide/NN steak/NN might/VB be/VB perfectly/JJ medium/NN rare/IN all/DT the/DT way/NN through/IN ,/, but/CC somehow/CC it/PRP misses/VB out/VB on/IN that/WDT smoky/NN ,/, beefy/NN char/NNP grilled/VBN flavor/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, more/RB importantly/JJ ,/, I/PRP feel/VB that/WDT with/IN the/DT Sous/JJ Vide/NN steak/NN ,/, somehow/IN the/DT fats/NNS do/VBP n't/RB melt/VB adequately/NN ./. I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ that/WDT Chef/NN Joshua/NN Brown/NN agreed/VBD with/IN my/PRP$ assessment/NN ./. He/PRP shared/VBD with/IN me/PRP that/IN CUT/PRP has/VBZ its/PRP$ own/JJ unique/NN way/NN of/IN cooking/NN steak/NN ./. First/IN the/DT steak/NN is/VBZ subjected/JJ to/TO the/DT high/JJ heat/NN of/IN a/DT broiler/NN before/IN being/VBG cooked/VBN in/IN a/DT special/JJ grill/NN that/WDT is/VBZ lined/RB with/IN bricks/NN ./. The/DT intense/NN heat/NN is/VBZ provided/VBD by/IN burning/NN apple/NN wood/NN and/CC mesquite/NN charcoal/NN which/WRB also/RB infuses/VB the/DT meat/NN with/IN that/DT wonderful/JJ smoky/NN flavor/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ then/RB left/JJ to/TO rest/NN properly/RB before/IN being/VBG quickly/RB heated/JJ up/IN again/RB under/IN the/DT broiler/JJ prior/JJ to/TO plating/VB ./. The/DT resulting/NN steak/NN had/VBD a/DT a/DT really/RB serious/JJ crust/NN enveloping/IN a/DT thin/JJ sliver/NN of/IN well/RB done/VBN beef/NN while/IN the/DT middle/JJ of/IN the/DT steak/NN was/VBD buttery/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ that/IN contrast/NN between/IN the/DT graduated/VBD doneness/NN of/IN the/DT external/NN rim/NN of/IN the/DT steak/NN and/CC the/DT medium/JJ rare/NN interior/NN that/IN creates/NN that/IN complexity/NN of/IN flavors/NNS in/IN a/DT great/JJ steak/NN ./. Sous/NNP Vide/NNP ?/. Perfect/JJ for/IN nice/JJ 62/NN degree/NN eggs/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP am/VBP not/RB big/JJ on/IN boiled/JJ steaks/NNS !/. The/DT service/NN at/IN Cut/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ and/CC Adam/JJ ,/, the/DT General/NN Manager/NN is/VBZ quite/RB a/DT character/NN as/IN you/PRP can/MD easily/RB tell/VB from/IN the/DT photo/NN ./. With/IN his/PRP$ thick/JJ Conneticut/NN accent/NN and/CC animated/JJ expressions/NN ,/, you/PRP might/VB momentarily/VB forget/VBP that/WDT you/PRP are/VBP in/IN Singapore/NNP rather/RB than/RB somewhere/VBN in/IN between/IN New/DT York/NN and/CC Boston/NN !/. If/IN you/PRP enjoy/VB wine/VB with/IN your/PRP$ meal/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD trust/VB him/PRP for/IN some/DT really/RB excellent/JJ wine/NN pairing/NN with/IN your/PRP$ courses/NN !/. For/INs desserts/NNS ,/, the/DT specialty/NN of/IN the/DT house/NN is/VBZ the/DT chocolate/NN souffle/NN ./. This/DT was/VBD again/RB excellent/JJ ,/, BUT/NN ,/, while/IN the/DT appetizers/NN and/CC steaks/NNS were/VBD a/DT cut/NN above/IN the/DT rest/NN ,/, the/DT souffle/NN is/VBZ something/NN that/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD we/PRP could/MD have/VB gotten/VBN at/IN some/DT other/JJ restaurants/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. Do/VBP n't/RB get/VB me/PRP wrong/JJ ,/, if/IN you/PRP love/VBP chocolate/NN ,/, the/DT velvety/NN chocolate/NN souffle/NN and/CC the/DT luxurious/JJ Valrhona/NN chocolate/NN sauce/NN will/MD not/RB fail/VB to/TO satisfy/VB that/IN chocaholic/NN in/IN you/PRP ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB that/IN it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB exceed/VB my/PRP$ expectations/NN like/IN how/RB the/DT earlier/NN courses/NN did/VBD ./. Conclusion/NN So/CC did/VBD CUT/NN ,/, cut/VB it/PRP ?/. In/IN short/NN ,/, yes/EX ./. But/CC like/IN all/DT the/DT other/JJ celebrity/NN restaurants/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB exactly/RB cheap/JJ ,/, but/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP after/IN a/DT perfectly/JJ cooked/VBN steak/NN ,/, then/RB this/DT is/VBZ the/DT place/NN for/IN that/DT uber/JJ steak/NN experience/NN ./. Having/VBG just/RB returned/JJ from/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ steakhouses/NN in/IN Chicago/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/IN my/PRP$ steak/NN experience/NN at/IN CUT/NN is/VBZ comparable/RB ,/, if/IN not/RB better/JJR than/IN my/PRP$ meal/NN in/IN the/DT US/NNP !/. CUT/VBD by/IN Wolfgang/NNP Puck/NNP Marina/NNP Bay/NNP Sands/NNP ,/, B1/NNP -LRB-/NNP close/VB to/TO the/DT theaters/JJ -RRB-/NN Opened/NN for/IN dinner/NN only/RB 66888517/.
