<title>Tong Chiang Claypot Restaurant: The Claypot Rice Is Just Bait</title>
<text>Review/JJ by/IN Joao/NN ,/, Photos/NN by/IN ieat/NN Before/IN we/PRP begin/VBD ,/, I/PRP want/VB to/TO caveat/VB that/IN I/PRP do/VBP not/RB harbor/VB some/DT clandestine/JJ Hakka/NN cuisine/NN revival/NN agenda/NN ./. Hot/DT on/IN the/DT heels/NN of/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ post/NN on/IN Mei/NNP Zhen/NNP Hakka/NNP Delicacies/NN comes/VBZ yet/RB another/JJ post/NN about/IN Hakka/NN food/NN ./. Completely/JJ coincidental/NN ,/, as/IN you/PRP will/MD soon/RB see/VB ./. Some/DT time/NN ago/RB we/PRP had/VBD an/DT interesting/JJ and/CC educational/JJ lunch/NN at/IN this/DT shop/NN on/IN the/DT corner/NN of/IN Lavender/NNP Street/NNP and/CC Serangoon/NNP Road/NNP ./. Tong/NNP Chiang/NNP Claypot/NN Restaurant/NN 's/VBZ main/JJ draw/NN is/VBZ their/PRP$ titular/JJ claypot/NN rice/NN ./. I/PRP had/VBD tried/VBN the/DT Claypot/JJ rice/NN at/IN Tong/NNP Chiang/NNP before/IN on/IN the/DT recommendation/NN of/IN some/JJ friends/NNS ,/, but/CC I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO see/VB how/WRB it/PRP compared/VBD to/TO Le/VB Chasseur/PRP 's/POS brilliant/NN Claypot/NN Rice/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP rallied/VBD some/JJ of/IN the/DT kakis/NNS and/CC we/PRP paid/NNP Tong/NNP Chiang/NNP a/DT visit/NN while/IN the/DT memory/NN of/IN Le/NNP Chasseur/NNP 's/POS version/NN was/VBD still/RB fresh/JJ on/IN everyone/NNP 's/POS minds/NNS ./. Straightaway/IN we/PRP noticed/VBD that/IN Tong/NNP Chiang/NNP 's/POS claypot/NN rice/NN did/VBD all/RB the/DT right/JJ things/NNS ./. For/IN instance/NN ,/, we/PRP inquired/VBD and/CC found/VBD that/WDT there/EX would/MD be/VB a/DT minimum/JJ 15/CD minute/NN wait/NN --/VBZ a/DT sign/NN that/IN the/DT claypot/JJ rice/NN was/VBD cooked/VBN on/IN the/DT spot/NN on/IN top/NN of/IN charcoal/NN fires/NN ./. Secondly/IN it/PRP contained/VBZ all/PDT the/DT requisite/NN ingredients/NNS for/IN good/JJ claypot/NN rice/NN --/NN fragrant/JJ waxed/VBN sausage/NN -LRB-/IN both/DT kinds/NN !/. -RRB-/RB ,/, salted/VBD fish/NN to/TO tease/VB the/DT palate/NN -LRB-/NN could/MD have/VB used/VBN a/DT bit/NN more/NN though/IN -RRB-/NN ,/, and/CC very/RB well/RB marinated/VBD pieces/NN of/IN chicken/NN ./. The/DT chicken/NN was/VBD especially/RB good/JJ ./. However/RB the/DT rice/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN lacking/NN in/IN that/DT charred/JJ flavor/NN that/WDT I/PRP like/VB ./. I/PRP had/VBD to/TO really/RB dig/VB around/IN and/CC scrape/VB the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT claypot/NN to/TO get/VB some/JJ mouthfuls/NN of/IN rice/NN that/WDT had/VBD that/WDT nice/JJ smokey/JJ flavor/NN ./. So/RB how/RB do/VB the/DT two/CD compare/VB ?/. Well/RB ,/, Tong/NNP Chiang/NNP 's/POS claypot/NN rice/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, maybe/RB worth/IN a/DT ,/, but/CC Le/NNP Chasseur/NNP 's/POS smokey/JJ charred/NN basmati/NN rice/NN blows/VBZ it/PRP out/VB of/IN the/DT water/NN ./. Still/EX there/EX 's/POS no/DT shame/NN in/IN losing/NNP out/RP to/TO our/PRP$ current/JJ gold/NN standard/JJ ./. This/DT claypot/NN rice/NN is/VBZ still/RB worth/JJ your/PRP$ time/NN ./. As/IN we/PRP tucked/VBD into/IN the/DT claypot/JJ rice/NN ,/, we/PRP noted/VBD something/NN peculiar/NN about/IN the/DT restaurant/NN 's/POS signboards/NN and/CC menu/NN --/IN the/DT menu/NN resembled/IN your/PRP$ typical/NNP cze/NNP char/NNP menu/NN with/IN its/PRP$ dishes/NNS categorised/RB neatly/JJ into/IN the/DT usual/JJ cze/NNP char/NNP food/NNP groups/NNP -LRB-/NNP e.g./NNP Vegetables/NNP ,/, Pork/NNP ,/, Chicken/NNP ,/, Seafood/NNP ,/, Toufu/NNP -RRB-/NNP but/CC there/RB seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT significant/JJ number/NN of/IN dishes/NNS that/WDT were/VBD either/RB named/VBD ``/NN Hakka/NN something-or-other/NN ''/NN or/CC dishes/NNS that/IN we/PRP recognized/VBD as/IN standards/NN of/IN Hakka/NN cuisine/NN ./. Our/PRP$ curiosity/JJ piqued/NN ,/, we/PRP ordered/VBD some/NN of/IN these/DT Hakka/NN dishes/NNS to/TO try/VB ./. While/WP we/PRP were/VBD waiting/VBG for/IN our/PRP$ food/NN to/TO arrive/NN ,/, we/PRP noticed/VBD a/DT wizened/JJ old/JJ chinese/NN man/NN having/VBG bak/NN kut/NN teh/NN and/CC rice/NN at/IN the/DT table/JJ next/JJ to/TO ours/VB ./. From/IN the/DT deference/NN that/IN the/DT shop/NN 's/POS employees/NN paid/NN him/PRP ,/, we/PRP were/VBD able/JJ to/TO conclude/VB that/IN he/PRP was/VBD the/DT boss/NN ./. What/WP luck/NN !/. The/DT shop/NN 's/POS owner/NN was/VBD there/RB at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN that/WDT we/PRP were/VBD !/. We/PRP quickly/RB introduced/VBD ourselves/NN and/CC he/PRP gave/VBD us/PRP$ a/DT primer/NN about/IN the/DT restaurant/NN and/CC the/DT dishes/NNS we/PRP ordered/VBD ./. Turns/JJ out/IN Tong/NNP Chiang/NNP Claypot/NNP Restaurant/NN has/VBZ been/VBN in/IN business/NN for/IN 15/CD years/NNS ./. They/PRP used/VBD to/TO be/VB at/IN Racecourse/NNP Road/NNP ,/, but/CC recently/RB they/PRP took/VBD over/IN this/DT coffeeshop/NN on/IN Lavender/NNP Street/NNP ./. Also/JJ ,/, the/DT owner/NN is/VBZ born-and-bred/JJ Hakka/NN ./. As/CC he/PRP waxed/VBN lyrical/NN about/IN the/DT dishes/NNS that/WDT were/VBD --/RB in/IN his/PRP$ words/JJ --/NN ``/NN 100/CD %/: authentic/JJ Hakka/NN ''/NN I/PRP got/VBD the/DT sense/NN that/IN this/DT was/VBD a/DT man/NN who/WP was/VBD passionate/JJ about/IN his/PRP$ culinary/JJ heritage/NN ./. But/CC hang/RB on/IN a/DT second/NN ./. Claypot/JJ rice/NN is/VBZ n't/RB Hakka/NN !/. Once/IN he/PRP paused/NN for/IN breath/NN we/PRP tactfully/VB put/VB this/DT to/TO him/PRP ,/, and/CC he/PRP sharply/VBZ rebuffed/IN us/PRP$ -LRB-/NN and/CC here/RB I/PRP 'm/VBP going/VBG to/TO rephrase/VB in/IN English/NN -RRB-/NN ,/, ``/NN Of/IN course/NN it/PRP 's/POS not/RB !/. But/CC which/WRB restaurant/NN do/VB you/PRP know/VB that/WDT serves/VBZ exclusively/RB Cantonese/JJ cuisine/NN ?/. Or/CC exclusively/JJ Hokkien/NN cuisine/NN ?/. There/EX 's/POS no/RB such/JJ thing/NN !/. ''/RB He/PRP went/VBD on/IN to/TO explain/VB that/IN most/JJ establishments/NNS run/VB by/IN the/DT Chinese/NNP diaspora/NNP in/IN South/NNP East/NNP Asia/NNP borrow/NNP bits/NNS and/CC pieces/NN from/IN other/JJ dialect/NN groups/NN and/CC thus/VBD the/DT cuisine/NN evolves/NN ./. That/DT made/VBD sense/NN ./. Similarly/JJ claypot/NN rice/NN is/VBZ n't/RB exclusive/VB to/TO any/DT one/CD dialect/NN group/NN ,/, but/CC Tong/NNP Chiang/NNP Claypot/NNP Restaurant/NN has/VBZ adopted/VBN it/PRP as/IN their/PRP$ mainstay/NN ,/, and/CC --/NN he/PRP told/VBD us/PRP with/IN a/DT gleam/NN in/IN his/PRP$ eye/NN --/NN as/IN bait/NN ./. When/WRB customers/PRP order/VB the/DT claypot/JJ rice/NN ,/, they/PRP also/RB feel/VB compelled/NN to/TO order/VB dishes/NNS from/IN the/DT cze/NNP char/NNP menu/NN ,/, and/CC that/WDT 's/POS when/WRB the/DT Hakka/NN dishes/NNS get/VB their/PRP$ chance/NN to/TO take/VB center/NN stage/NN ./. Clever/JJ !/. If/IN you/PRP look/VBP at/IN the/DT Tong/NNP Chiang/NNP menu/NN ,/, you/PRP 'll/MD notice/VB that/IN some/JJ dishes/NNS have/VB a/DT red/JJ dot/NN next/JJ to/TO them/PRP --/VBD that/IN denotes/NN that/IN the/DT dish/NN is/VBZ of/IN Hakka/NN origin/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP did/VBD n't/RB know/VB this/DT you/PRP might/VB think/VB those/DT dots/JJ indicated/NN chef/NN recommendations/NN -LRB-/NN which/WDT ,/, in/IN hindsight/NN ,/, they/PRP probably/RB are/VBP -RRB-/JJ which/WDT would/MD subtly/RB make/VB you/PRP more/RB likely/VBD to/TO order/VB them/PRP ./. Take/VB for/IN example/NN the/DT Hakka/NNP Yong/NNP Tau/NNP Fu/NNP ./. Large/DT pieces/NN of/IN soft/JJ tofu/NN topped/VBD with/IN a/DT delicious/JJ pork/NN and/CC fish/NN meat/NN mixture/NN and/CC served/VBD in/IN a/DT claypot/NN of/IN tasty/JJ gravy/NN ./. This/DT blog/NN is/VBZ already/RB well-acquainted/JJ with/IN the/DT concept/NN of/IN Hakka/NNP Yong/NNP Tau/NNP Fu/NNP ,/, so/RB we/PRP can/MD vouch/VB for/IN the/DT standard/JJ of/IN this/DT dish/NN ./. The/DT standout/NN dish/NN of/IN the/DT day/NN would/MD have/VB to/TO have/VB been/VBN the/DT 酒糟鸡/JJ -LRB-/NN Chicken/NN with/IN Rice/NNP Wine/NNP -RRB-/NNP --/NNP tender/NN pieces/NN of/IN chicken/NN covered/NN in/IN a/DT thick/JJ red/JJ gravy/NN with/IN a/DT sweet-sour/JJ slightly-fermented/NN flavor/NN grows/VBZ on/IN you/PRP with/IN every/DT mouthful/NN ./. This/DT dish/NN can/MD be/VB described/VBN in/IN one/CD word/NN --/NN ``/NN addictive/NN ./. ''/RB We/PRP gave/VBD the/DT gaffer/NN our/JJ hearty/NN approval/NN for/IN the/DT dish/NN ,/, and/CC he/PRP proceeded/VBD to/TO tell/VB us/PRP the/DT laborious/JJ process/NN that/WDT went/VBD into/IN making/VBG the/DT tasty/JJ tasty/JJ gravy/NN ./. As/CC most/JJ people/NN would/MD already/RB know/VB ,/, the/DT distinctive/NN red/JJ color/NN of/IN this/DT dish/NN comes/VBZ from/IN the/DT addition/NN of/IN red/JJ yeast/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT dish/NN 's/POS unique/NN texture/NN and/CC flavor/NN comes/VBZ from/IN the/DT addition/NN of/IN a/DT secret/NN ingredient/NN that/IN the/DT owner/NN shared/NN with/IN us/PRP ./. Turns/JJ out/IN that/WDT the/DT owners/NNS -LRB-/IN Hakka/NN -RRB-/NN family/NN makes/VBZ their/PRP$ own/JJ traditional/JJ glutinous/JJ rice/NN wine/NN ./. -LRB-/. It/PRP 's/VBZ apparently/JJ legal/NN if/IN you/PRP make/VB less/JJ than/IN 3/CD litres/NNS and/CC do/VBP n't/RB sell/VB it/PRP ./. -RRB-/IN This/DT special/JJ glutinous/JJ rice/NN wine/NN is/VBZ used/VBD in/IN cooking/NN many/JJ traditional/JJ Hakka/NN dishes/NNS ,/, but/CC in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN this/DT particular/JJ dish/NN ,/, the/DT dregs/NN from/IN fermenting/JJ the/DT glutinous/JJ rice/NN are/VBZ ground/JJ up/NN and/CC added/VBD to/TO the/DT red/JJ gravy/NN to/TO give/VB it/PRP its/PRP$ distinctive/JJ thickness/NN and/CC slightly/RB wine-y/JJ flavor/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ a/DT dish/NN that/WDT 's/VBZ probably/RB impossible/JJ for/IN most/NN of/IN us/PRP to/TO make/VB at/IN home/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ a/DT must/VB try/VB ./. It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB all/DT hits/NN and/CC no/RB misses/JJ ,/, however/NN ./. We/PRP ordered/VBD the/DT 客家小炒/NNP -LRB-/NNP Fried/NNP Hakka/NNP Vegetables/NN -RRB-/NN even/RB though/IN we/PRP 'd/MD never/RB heard/VBN of/IN it/PRP ./. The/DT boss/NN vouched/NN for/IN it/PRP 's/POS authenticity/NN though/IN ,/, and/CC since/IN none/NN of/IN us/PRP were/VBD Hakka/NN we/PRP were/VBD n't/RB about/IN to/TO doubt/VB him/PRP at/IN his/PRP$ word/NN ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT vegetable/JJ dish/NN comprised/NN of/IN stir-fried/NN cuttlefish/NN ,/, snowpeas/NN ,/, celery/NN ,/, scallions/NNS and/CC leek/NN ./. The/DT aroma/NN of/IN alliums/NN combined/NN with/IN the/DT snowpeas/NN to/TO give/VB this/DT dish/NN a/DT fresh/JJ grassy/JJ flavor/NN ./. Unfortunately/RB the/DT cuttlefish/JJ seemed/NN a/DT little/JJ out/JJ of/IN place/NN ,/, and/CC did/VBD n't/RB do/VB anything/NN for/IN me/PRP ./. This/DT was/VBD tasty/JJ enough/JJ ,/, but/CC forgettable/RB in/IN comparison/NN to/TO the/DT other/JJ dishes/NNS we/PRP tried/VBD ./. Conclusion/NN So/CC there/RB you/PRP have/VB it/PRP ./.
