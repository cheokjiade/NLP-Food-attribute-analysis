<title>Devagi's: Recipes from a cookbook comes alive!</title>
<text>Ever/RB looked/VBD at/IN a/DT cookbook/NN and/CC wonder/VB what/WP the/DT stuff/NN actually/RB tastes/VBZ like/IN in/IN real/JJ life/NN ?/. I/PRP have/VBP ,/, and/CC when/WRB I/PRP try/VB to/TO follow/VB the/DT recipe/NN the/DT dish/NN may/MD end/VB up/IN looking/VBG almost/RB like/IN the/DT photo/NN ,/, but/CC tastewise/CC it/PRP falters/RB half/VBD the/DT time/NN ./. Perhaps/RB its/PRP$ just/RB my/PRP$ poor/JJ cooking/NN skills/NN ,/, or/CC could/VB it/PRP be/VB that/IN they/PRP just/RB publish/VBD a/DT recipe/NN that/WDT looks/VBZ good/JJ on/IN paper/NN so/IN they/PRP can/MD sell/VB cookbooks/RB ?/. Well/RB ,/, wonder/VB no/RB more/RB !/. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT fan/NN of/IN everything/NN spicy/JJ and/CC especially/RB if/IN you/PRP own/JJ any/RB of/IN Devagi/NN 's/POS 16/NN cookbooks/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD now/RB taste/VB the/DT original/JJ dish/NN as/IN depicted/NN in/IN her/PRP cookbooks/NN ,/, cooked/VBN by/IN the/DT cook/VB -LRB-/NN chef/NN lah/PRP -RRB-/VBD herself/RB !/. Yes/EX ,/, Singapore/NNP 's/POS very/RB own/JJ Spice/NN Queen/NN and/CC media/NN spokesperson/NN for/IN the/DT Asia/NNP Food/NNP Channel/NNP --/NNP Devagi/NNP can/MD now/RB be/VB hired/JJ -LRB-/NN well/RB sort/NN of/IN right/NN ?/. -RRB-/CC to/TO whip/VB up/IN your/PRP$ favorite/NN spice/NN dish/NN from/IN any/DT one/CD of/IN her/PRP cookbooks/JJ right/NN here/RB in/IN her/PRP restaurant/NN ./. Then/RB you/PRP can/MD see/VB how/RB it/PRP compares/VBZ to/TO your/PRP$ own/JJ version/NN when/WRB you/PRP tried/VBD to/TO follow/VB the/DT recipe/NN !/. Devagi/JJ fuses/NN Indonesian/NN ,/, Chinese/NNP ,/, Thai/JJ and/CC Malaysian/JJ influences/NN into/IN her/PRP own/JJ South/NN Indian/NN style/NN cuisine/NN ./. Sounds/NNS like/IN how/WRB your/PRP$ own/JJ mom/NNP cooks/NNP ?/. Well/UH yes/EX ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT true/JJ Singaporean/NN homestyle/NN cooking/NN ,/, except/NN of/IN course/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ done/VBN at/IN an/DT expert/JJ level/NN ./. The/DT Ikan/NN Bilis/NN fried/VBD rice/NN for/IN instance/NN is/VBZ a/DT fried/JJ Briyani/NN rice/NN with/IN ikan/NN bilis/NN and/CC infused/NN with/IN indian/JJ spices/NNS and/CC raisins/NN ./. It/PRP combines/VBZ a/DT wok/NN hei/NN flavor/NN of/IN a/DT good/JJ fried/VBD rice/NN with/IN the/DT spicy/JJ aroma/NN of/IN a/DT briyani/NN ./. This/DT sort/NN of/IN ``/NNP Chindian/NNP ''/NNP dish/NN should/MD really/RB hit/VB the/DT spot/NN for/IN a/DT guy/NN like/IN Gurmit/NN Singh/NN yah/JJ ?/. I/PRP jest/VBD ./. The/DT flavors/NNS combine/RB very/RB well/RB and/CC we/PRP all/RB liked/VBD it/PRP ./. There/EX were/VBD other/JJ ``/NNP Chindian/NNP ''/NNP dishes/NNS that/IN we/PRP sampled/VBD as/IN well/RB ,/, like/IN the/DT stir/NN fried/VBD long/JJ beans/NNS with/IN egg/NN and/CC the/DT stir/NN fried/VBD cabbage/NN with/IN dried/JJ prawns/NNS and/CC masala/NN ./. Another/JJ dish/NN which/WDT was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ was/VBD the/DT ./. The/DT Sambal/NNP has/VBZ got/VBN a/DT strong/JJ Indian/NN influence/NN and/CC is/VBZ almost/RB like/IN a/DT cross/NN between/IN Sambal/NNP and/CC Tandoori/JJ fish/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD great/JJ with/IN the/DT cinchaluk/NN ./. We/PRP also/RB sampled/VBD her/PRP Hyderabad/JJ dum/NN briyani/NN which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT top/JJ selling/VBG dish/NN there/RB ./. Unfortunately/RB ,/, it/PRP did/VBD not/RB quite/RB hit/IN the/DT spot/NN for/IN me/PRP that/WDT day/NN ./. It/PRP could/MD be/VB that/IN she/PRP did/VBD not/RB cook/VB it/PRP with/IN saffron/NN that/IN day/NN which/WDT she/PRP normally/RB does/VBD ./. There/EX are/VBP also/RB many/JJ different/JJ versions/NN of/IN Fish/NNP Head/NNP Curry/NNP to/TO suit/VB a/DT whole/JJ range/NN of/IN tastes/VBZ ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT kind/NN of/IN place/NN that/IN the/DT Tourism/JJ Board/NN would/MD promote/VB ./. Uniquely/JJ Singaporean/NN cuisine/NN ,/, cooked/VBN by/IN a/DT famous/JJ TV/NN personality/NN and/CC Chef/NN ./. Great/JJ place/NN to/TO bring/VB your/PRP$ foreign/JJ visitors/NN to/TO introduce/VB them/PRP to/TO Singapore/NNP 's/POS multicultural/NN cuisine/NN ./. But/CC come/VB prepared/VBD to/TO be/VB spiced/JJ up/NN ./. I/PRP had/VBD a/DT spice/NN overdose/NN that/IN day/NN because/IN after/IN the/DT fifth/JJ dish/NN ,/, I/PRP found/VBD it/PRP increasingly/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO tell/VB the/DT difference/NN between/IN the/DT various/JJ curries/NNS !/. </text>
