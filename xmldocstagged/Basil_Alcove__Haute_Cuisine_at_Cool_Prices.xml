In/IN order/NN to/TO provide/VB Fine/NN Food/NN at/IN rock/NNP bottom/NNP prices/NN ,/, something/NN 's/POS gotta/UH give/JJ ./. Here/RB you/PRP get/VB your/PRP$ culinary/JJ masterpiece/NN and/CC nothing/NN else/RB ./. No/JJ Tuxedo/NN ,/, no/RB candlelight/NN ,/, no/RB posh/JJ furniture/NN ,/, no/RB table/JJ napkins/NN ,/, not/RB even/RB aircon/JJ ./. -LRB-/JJ Well/IN there/RB is/VBZ a/DT small/JJ section/NN next/JJ to/TO the/DT kitchen/NN in/IN the/DT shop/NN which/WRB has/VBZ aircon/NN and/CC spotlights/NN and/CC I/PRP guess/VBP you/PRP can/MD buy/VB candles/RB from/IN the/DT numerous/JJ religious/NN shops/NN in/IN Fortune/NN Centre/NN -RRB-/NN ./. This/DT little/JJ shop/NN along/IN Middle/NN road/NN used/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN stall/NN ./. Half/IN the/DT stall/NN has/VBZ been/VBN converted/JJ into/IN the/DT kitchen/NN ,/, bar/NN and/CC cashier/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT other/JJ half/NN into/IN a/DT dining/NN area/NN with/IN room/NN for/IN 6/CD persons/NNS ./. There/EX is/VBZ room/JJ for/IN another/DT 20/CD to/TO enjoy/VB Al/NNP Fresco/NNP Style/NNP Haute/NNP Cuisine/NNP next/RB to/TO busy/VB Middle/NN road/NN ./. Welcome/JJ to/TO Singapore/NNP 's/POS first/JJ -LRB-/NN at/IN least/RB to/TO my/PRP$ knowledge/JJ -RRB-/NNP Coffeeshop/NNP Fine/NNP Dining/NNP experience/NN !/.

I/PRP hope/VBP you/PRP are/VBP impressed/JJ ,/, because/CC I/PRP certainly/RB was/VBD ./. For/IN $/$ 6.80/CD you/PRP would/MD not/RB expect/VB them/PRP to/TO give/VB you/PRP such/RB an/DT exotic/JJ salad/NN ./. I/PRP had/VBD expected/VBN Iceberg/NN Lettuce/NN and/CC local/NN tomatoes/NN ./. I/PRP thought/VBD the/DT salad/NN dressing/VBG was/VBD a/DT little/JJ too/RB spicy/JJ for/IN me/PRP as/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT balsamic/NN vinegrette/NN with/IN chilli/NN padi/NN ./. Good/JJ for/IN those/RB who/WP always/RB order/VB their/PRP$ Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP with/IN extra/JJ chilli/NN ./. But/CC you/PRP got/VBD to/TO give/VB it/PRP to/TO Chef/NN Xander/NN ./. For/IN a/DT salad/NN at/IN this/DT price/NN ,/, you/PRP got/VBD your/PRP$ Aragula/NN ,/, your/PRP$ extra/JJ virgin/NN olive/NN oil/NN ,/, fresh/JJ basil/JJ and/CC real/JJ shredded/VBN parmesan/NN -LRB-/NN not/RB the/DT Kraft/JJ type/NN that/WDT needs/VBZ no/RB refrigeration/JJ -RRB-/. The/DT $/$ 6.80/CD set/NN lunch/NN came/VBD with/IN the/DT Chicken/NN and/CC Mushroom/NN Aglio/NN which/WRB everyone/VBZ liked/VBD ./. We/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG a/DT whole/JJ chicken/NN thigh/NN fillet/NN with/IN really/RB succulent/JJ shitake/NN mushrooms/NNS tossed/VBD in/IN spaghetti/NN with/IN a/DT nice/JJ garlicky/NN Aglio/NN sauce/NN ./. $/$ 6.80/CD with/IN the/DT salad/NN and/CC a/DT drink/NN some/NN more/NN !!/NN Ca/RB n't/RB believe/VB it/PRP !/. The/DT Green/NN Frisee/NN with/IN Calamari/NN was/VBD about/IN the/DT only/JJ item/NN that/WDT I/PRP did/VBD not/RB quite/RB like/IN ./. The/DT element/NN I/PRP did/VBD like/IN was/VBD the/DT fresh/JJ beetroot/NN which/WDT was/VBD crunchy/JJ and/CC sweet/JJ and/CC gave/VBD the/DT calamari/NN that/IN red/JJ coloring/NN ./. Interesting/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP will/VB try/VB something/NN else/RB next/JJ time/NN ./. $/$ 7.80/CD You/PRP can/MD order/VB the/DT Baked/NNP Pacific/NNP Dory/NNP as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT set/NN lunch/NN set/NN for/IN $/$ 8.80/CD ./. This/DT is/VBZ probably/RB the/DT nicest/NN looking/VBG sub/IN $/$ 10/CD main/JJ course/NN you/PRP will/MD find/VB anywhere/NN ./. The/DT fish/NN was/VBD done/VBN very/RB well/RB ./. Crisp/DT on/IN the/DT outside/NN ,/, yet/RB still/RB juicy/JJ on/IN the/DT inside/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ served/VBD with/IN a/DT pineapple/JJ rice/NN which/WDT is/VBZ somewhere/JJ between/IN a/DT risotto/NN and/CC a/DT fried/JJ rice/NN ./. Think/DT of/IN Nasi/NNP Lemak/NNP cooked/VBN with/IN fresh/JJ cream/NN instead/RB of/IN coconut/NN cream/NN ./. This/DT one/CD is/VBZ really/RB worth/JJ ordering/VBG if/IN not/RB just/RB to/TO look/VB at/IN the/DT expressions/NN of/IN delight/NN and/CC amazement/NN around/IN the/DT table/NN ./. At/IN just/RB twenty/VB three/CD ,/, Chef/NN Xander/NNP has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN in/IN the/DT kitchens/NN of/IN New/NN York/NN ,/, Sydney/NN and/CC a/DT few/JJ of/IN the/DT top/JJ hotels/NNS locally/RB ./. This/DT guy/NN simply/NN loves/NN to/TO cook/VB ./. You/PRP have/VBP to/TO be/VB really/RB passionate/JJ in/IN order/NN to/TO whip/VB up/IN a/DT Roasted/JJ Rack/NN of/IN Lamb/NNP like/IN this/DT in/IN a/DT coffeeshop/NN !/. And/CC he/PRP tries/VBD to/TO use/VB as/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT good/JJ stuff/NN as/IN he/PRP can/MD ./. Take/VB for/IN example/NN the/DT use/VB of/IN Sundried/NN Tomatoes/NN and/CC Chives/NN in/IN the/DT picture/NN above/NN ./. His/PRP kitchen/NN is/VBZ full/JJ of/IN the/DT wonderful/JJ exotic/NN herbs/NNS and/CC spices/NNS that/IN you/PRP can/MD only/RB find/VB in/IN really/RB classy/JJ establishments/NNS ./. The/DT lamb/NN was/VBD done/VBN to/TO perfection/VB ./. Now/JJ ,/, tastewise/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB as/IN flavoursome/JJ as/IN a/DT high/JJ grade/NN New/NN Zealand/NN lamb/NN ./. Like/. I/PRP said/JJ earlier/NN ,/, it/PRP order/VB to/TO provide/VB Fine/NN Cuisine/NN at/IN rock/NNP bottom/NNP prices/NN ,/, something/NN 's/POS gotta/UH give/JJ ./. You/PRP can/MD not/RB expect/VB to/TO pay/VB $/$ 14.80/CD and/CC get/VB the/DT best/JJS Top/NNP Grade/NNP Lamb/NNP rack/NN ./. But/CC seriously/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP give/VBP this/DT guy/NN a/DT bigger/JJR kitchen/NN and/CC a/DT take/VB off/IN the/DT budget/NN constraints/NN he/PRP 'll/VB whip/VB up/IN a/DT storm/NN for/IN you/PRP !/. The/DT Chilean/NNP Cod/NNP with/IN Garlic/JJ Cream/NN Sauce/NN was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ ,/, although/RB ,/, again/RB ,/, do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB the/DT highest/JJ grade/NN Blue/IN Eye/NNP Cod/NNP ./. The/DT flesh/NN lacks/VBZ the/DT creamy/JJ oily/JJ flavor/NN of/IN a/DT really/RB good/JJ Cod/NNP and/CC the/DT texture/NN is/VBZ a/DT bit/NN rough/NN ./. But/CC the/DT presentation/NN ,/, the/DT sauce/NN and/CC the/DT sides/NNS are/VBP all/DT excellent/NN ./. A/DT good/JJ Cod/NNP dish/NN like/IN this/DT in/IN a/DT Hotel/NN would/MD easily/RB set/NN you/PRP back/RB at/IN least/RB $/$ 30/CD ./. Here/RB it/PRP 's/POS $/$ 18.90/CD ./. Definitely/RB good/JJ value/NN for/IN a/DT tasty/JJ piece/NN of/IN Cod/NNP ./. Again/RB ,/, notice/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT sides/NN ./. You/PRP can/MD just/RB about/IN make/VB out/IN the/DT fresh/JJ tomato/NN salsa/NN and/CC the/DT button/NN mushrooms/NNS that/IN he/PRP provided/VBD ./. Ducks/NNS are/VBP funny/JJ ./. It/PRP can/MD be/VB very/RB affordable/JJ when/WRB you/PRP eat/VB Roast/NNP Duck/NNP ,/, Braised/NNP Duck/NNP or/CC Kiam/NNP Chye/NNP Ah/NN -LRB-/NN Salted/JJ Veg/NNP Duck/NNP -RRB-/NNP ,/, but/CC when/WRB you/PRP order/VB Duck/NN at/IN a/DT fancy/JJ western/NN Restaurant/NN ,/, suddenly/RB you/PRP pay/VB a/DT bomb/NN for/IN it/PRP !/. True/JJ to/TO his/PRP$ vision/NN of/IN providing/NN Fine/NN Dining/NN to/TO the/DT masses/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD get/VB this/DT French/JJ Style/NNP Pan/NNP Fried/NNP Duck/NNP Breast/NN for/IN just/RB $/$ 13.80/CD ./. The/DT duck/NN was/VBD done/VBN very/RB well/RB and/CC the/DT Pesto/JJ Oil/NN dressing/VBG was/VBD excellent/JJ with/IN the/DT duck/NN meat/NN ./. Next/CC time/NN I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG to/TO ask/VB Xander/NN to/TO give/VB me/PRP a/DT savoury/JJ cream/NN based/VBD sauce/NN to/TO try/VB ./. All/PDT the/DT women/NN on/IN the/DT table/NN loved/VBD the/DT duck/NN ./. Xander/DT tells/VBZ me/PRP this/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/NN popular/JJ dish/NN with/IN the/DT girls/NN ./.

I/PRP can/MD almost/RB guarantee/VB that/IN your/PRP$ first/JJ visit/NN to/TO Basil/VB Alcove/PRP would/MD be/VB a/DT delightful/JJ experience/NN ./. That/DT 's/POS because/CC when/WRB you/PRP see/VB that/WDT tiny/JJ kitchen/NN ,/, the/DT coffeeshop/NN tables/NN ,/, the/DT low/JJ prices/NN and/CC the/DT Chef/NN that/WDT looks/VBZ like/IN an/DT Ah/NN Beng/NN version/NN of/IN Steven/NN Segal/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD NEVER/RB expect/VB that/IN beautiful/NN piece/NN of/IN culinary/JJ art/NN served/VBD at/IN your/PRP$ table/NN !/.
