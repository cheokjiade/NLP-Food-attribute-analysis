<title>New Lucky Claypot Rice: The thing about Claypots.....</title>
<text>Claypots/JJ ./. They/PRP are/VBP just/RB not/RB meant/VB for/IN hawkers/NNS to/TO use/VB ./. Have/VB you/PRP ever/RB notice/VB what/WP the/DT hawkers/NNS do/VB with/IN their/PRP$ claypots/NN ?/. They/PRP always/RB reinforce/VB it/PRP with/IN some/JJ kind/NN of/IN metal/NN wire/NN ./. Why/JJ ?/. Because/JJ most/NN of/IN them/PRP are/VBP cracked/JJ ./. Most/JJS of/IN the/DT hawkers/NNS who/WP sell/VB Claypot/NN rice/NN tell/VB me/PRP that/WDT they/PRP usually/RB discard/VB their/PRP$ Claypots/NN after/IN only/RB a/DT few/JJ uses/VBZ ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ almost/RB like/IN a/DT disposable/JJ cooking/NN utensil/NN !/. So/RB here/RB is/VBZ the/DT conundrum/NN ./. Why/DT did/VBD the/DT Chinese/NNP invent/NNP such/IN a/DT useless/JJ cooking/NN utensil/NN which/WRB cracks/VBZ so/RB easily/RB ?/. In/IN order/NN to/TO increase/VB the/DT useful/JJ lifespan/NN of/IN their/PRP$ claypots/NN ,/, most/RB Hawkers/JJ devise/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ ways/NN to/TO reinforce/VB their/PRP$ claypots/NN ./. Now/RB here/RB 's/POS another/DT thought/NN ./. Why/PRP do/VBP n't/RB the/DT claypot/JJ manufacturer/NN 's/POS simply/NN just/RB make/VB claypots/NN with/IN the/DT metal/NN reinforcement/NN already/RB attached/VBG ?/. Seems/NNS like/IN the/DT logical/JJ thing/NN to/TO do/VB right/RB ?/. Well/RB ,/, the/DT short/NN answer/NN to/TO this/DT long/JJ question/NN is/VBZ that/WDT our/PRP$ Hawkers/JJ simply/NNS do/VBP n't/RB use/VB the/DT claypots/JJ according/NN to/TO the/DT manufacturer/NN 's/POS instructions/NN ./. -LRB-/DT Not/RB that/WDT there/EX are/VBP instructions/JJ anyway/NN -RRB-/NN ./. The/DT reason/NN for/IN the/DT existence/NN of/IN the/DT unglazed/NN claypot/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP cooks/JJ food/NN differently/NN from/IN a/DT normal/JJ steel/NN pot/NN ./. You/PRP are/VBP supposed/JJ to/TO soak/VB it/PRP first/RB so/RB that/IN water/NN is/VBZ absorbed/JJ into/IN the/DT porous/NN clay/NN ./. Then/RB when/WRB you/PRP heat/NN it/PRP GENTLY/RB ,/, the/DT water/NN in/IN the/DT clay/NN turns/VBZ to/TO steam/VB and/CC steams/VB the/DT food/NN in/IN the/DT claypot/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ meant/JJ to/TO be/VB used/VBD with/IN gentle/NN heat/NN and/CC with/IN an/DT adequate/NN soaking/VBG in/IN water/NN before/IN the/DT next/JJ use/VB !/. Here/RB herein/RB lies/VBZ the/DT problem/NN ./. Which/DT hawker/NN has/VBZ the/DT time/NN to/TO soak/VB the/DT claypot/NN and/CC cook/VB the/DT rice/NN under/IN gentle/NN heat/NN ?/. Most/JJS people/NNS already/RB complain/VB about/IN the/DT minimum/JJ 20/CD minute/NN wait/NN to/TO eat/VB Claypot/NN rice/NN ./. So/CC the/DT solution/NN is/VBZ to/TO turn/VB up/IN the/DT heat/NN and/CC reinforce/VBD the/DT pots/NN with/IN metal/NN !/. In/IN case/NN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB it/PRP yet/RB ,/, the/DT famous/JJ New/NNP Lucky/NNP Claypot/NNP Rice/NNP which/WDT used/VBD to/TO be/VB a/DT Clementi/JJ ``/NN must/MD eat/VB ''/RB has/VBZ relocated/VBN to/TO Holland/VB Drive/VB not/RB long/RB ago/RB ./. Now/RB they/PRP occupy/VB two/CD whole/JJ stalls/NNS in/IN the/DT food/NN center/NN ./. I/PRP have/VB wanted/VBD to/TO blog/VB New/RB Lucky/RB since/IN they/PRP were/VBD still/RB at/IN Clementi/NN ,/, but/CC when/WRB I/PRP eventually/RB got/VBD round/NN to/TO it/PRP ,/, they/PRP have/VBN already/RB moved/VBD to/TO Holland/VB Drive/NN !/. Like/DT most/NN good/JJ Claypot/NN Rice/NN places/NNS ,/, the/DT rice/NN is/VBZ cooked/VBN in/IN the/DT claypot/NN itself/PRP ./. That/DT ,/, for/IN me/PRP ,/, is/VBZ the/DT minimum/JJ criteria/NN for/IN me/PRP to/TO even/RB order/VB it/PRP ./. Some/DT places/NNS cheat/VBD by/IN assembling/NN cooked/VBN rice/NN plus/JJ ingredients/NNS in/IN the/DT claypot/NN and/CC just/RB char/NNP the/DT rice/NN slightly/RB inside/NN of/IN the/DT claypot/NN ./. Forget/CC it/PRP ./. Might/JJ as/IN well/RB just/RB order/VB a/DT plate/NN of/IN fried/VBN rice/NN ./. The/DT other/JJ key/NN ingredients/NNS are/VBP the/DT marinade/NN in/IN the/DT chicken/NN ,/, quality/NN of/IN the/DT lup/NNP cheong/NNP -LRB-/NNP Chinese/NNP sausages/NNS -RRB-/RB ,/, good/RB salted/VBD fish/NN flavor/NN and/CC most/NN importantly/NN ,/, a/DT great/JJ dark/JJ soy/NN sauce/NN ./. Of/IN these/DT ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/IN New/NN Lucky/NN scored/VBD highest/NN on/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT lup/NN cheong/NN which/WDT had/VBD that/RB wonderful/JJ floral/NN fragrance/NN which/WRB I/PRP thoroughly/VBD enjoyed/VBN ./. The/DT chicken/NN was/VBD cooked/VBN just/RB right/RB such/JJ that/IN it/PRP was/VBD tender/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT marinade/NN could/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT little/JJ more/JJ fragrant/JJ ./. I/PRP think/VB they/PRP cut/VB down/VB on/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN salted/VBN fish/NN because/IN people/NN nowadays/RB do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO eat/VB too/RB much/JJ of/IN it/PRP ./. I/PRP would/MD ask/VB for/IN more/NN salted/VBD fish/NN next/JJ time/NN though/IN ./. I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ that/IN the/DT dark/JJ soy/NN sauce/NN was/VBD a/DT special/JJ blend/NN from/IN a/DT few/JJ selected/NN manufacturers/NN which/WRB they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN using/VBG for/IN many/JJ years/NNS ./. It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ but/CC I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB help/VB but/CC wish/VB I/PRP had/VBD brought/VBN along/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ bottle/NN of/IN one/CD and/CC a/DT half/JJ year/NN ,/, naturally/NNP fermented/NNP Dark/NNP Soy/NNP Sauce/NNP from/IN Kwong/NNP Woh/NNP Hing/NNP ./. 4\/5/DT Conclusion/NN Good/JJ claypot/NN rice/NN with/IN excellent/JJ lup/NN cheong/NN but/CC I/PRP have/VBP this/DT niggling/NN feeling/VBG that/IN it/PRP must/MD have/VB been/VBN better/NN in/IN the/DT past/IN ./. Any/RB long/JJ time/NN fans/NNS of/IN this/DT place/NN who/WP can/MD attest/VB to/TO this/DT ?/.
