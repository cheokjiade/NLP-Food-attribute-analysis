<text>I/PRP guess/VB in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, BBQ/NNP means/NN putting/JJ chicken/NN wings/NNS and/CC sausages/NNS over/IN a/DT charcoal/JJ grill/NN ./. The/DT Aussies/NN and/CC British/NN certainly/RB would/MD think/VB of/IN BBQ/NN in/IN the/DT same/JJ way/NN ./. But/CC in/IN in/IN the/DT US/NNP ,/, the/DT BBQ/NN has/VBZ a/DT whole/JJ different/JJ meaning/NN ./. Over/RB there/RB ,/, BBQ/NNP meats/NNS are/VBP smoked/VBD over/IN a/DT long/JJ period/NN of/IN time/NN such/NN that/IN a/DT whole/JJ slab/NN of/IN Pork/NNP Collar/NNP becomes/NNP so/RB tender/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ that/IN it/PRP can/MD be/VB shredded/VBN by/IN hand/NN ./. The/DT slow/JJ smoking/NN method/NN also/RB infuses/VBZ the/DT meat/NN with/IN a/DT wonderful/JJ smokey/JJ aroma/NN which/WDT is/VBZ lacking/RB if/IN it/PRP was/VBD cooked/VBN in/IN a/DT conventional/JJ oven/NN ./. Our/PRP$ friend/NN ,/, Soundman/RB has/VBZ gone/VBN a/DT bit/NN crazy/JJ over/IN the/DT BBQ/NN and/CC went/VBD off/RP to/TO the/DT US/NNP to/TO become/VBN a/DT certified/JJ BBQ/NN judge/NN ./. Now/RB he/PRP has/VBZ started/VBD importing/NN BBQ/NN smokers/NN from/IN the/DT US/NNP which/WDT comes/VBZ with/IN timer/NN and/CC temperature/NN control/NN ./. So/RB if/IN you/PRP wish/VBP to/TO smoke/VB some/DT Baby/JJ Backs/NN for/IN your/PRP$ dinner/NN party/NN. ,/, its/PRP$ simply/JJ a/DT matter/NN of/IN placing/NN your/PRP$ meat/NN in/IN the/DT oven/NN ,/, setting/IN the/DT timer/NN and/CC wait/NN for/IN your/PRP$ friends/NNS to/TO arrive/VB ./. In/IN this/DT video/NN ,/, Soundman/RB shows/VB us/PRP how/RB to/TO make/VB some/DT authentic/JJ Southern/NNP pulled/NNP pork/NN sandwiches/NN ./. Basically/RB you/PRP apply/VB a/DT dry/JJ rub/NN over/IN the/DT pork/NN ,/, then/RB place/NN it/PRP in/IN the/DT oven/NN ,/, set/NN the/DT temperature/NN to/TO 225/VB degrees/NNS Fareinheit/RB and/CC leave/VB it/PRP for/IN the/DT next/JJ 12/CD hours/NNS ./. You/PRP end/VB up/VB with/IN a/DT wonderfully/JJ aromatic/NN piece/NN of/IN pork/NN where/WRB all/PDT the/DT connective/NN tissues/NN have/VBZ turned/VBD into/IN gelatin/NN ./. That/DT means/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ tender/JJ enough/JJ to/TO be/VB shreded/VBD by/IN hand/NN after/IN that/IN all/DT you/PRP have/VB to/TO do/VB is/VBZ to/TO fill/VB your/PRP$ bun/NN with/IN the/DT juicy/JJ morsels/NN ,/, add/VB BBQ/NN sauce/NN and/CC coleslaw/NN and/CC you/PRP got/VBD yourself/PRP$ an/DT American/JJ classic/NN !/. Best/NN of/IN all/NN ,/, it/PRP makes/VBZ feeding/RB a/DT hungry/JJ mob/NN a/DT real/JJ simple/JJ affair/NN !/. For/IN more/JJ info/NN about/IN the/DT BBQ/NN ovens/NN ,/, please/NN visit/NN Soundman/NN 's/POS website/NN :/: www.smoque.sg/NNP ./.
