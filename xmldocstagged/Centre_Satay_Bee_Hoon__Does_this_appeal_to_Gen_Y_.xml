<title>Centre Satay Bee Hoon: Does this appeal to Gen Y?</title>
<text>Peanuts/JJ ./. I/PRP think/VB peanuts/NNS are/VBP very/RB underrated/JJ ./. If/IN you/PRP think/VB of/IN it/PRP ,/, peanuts/NNS are/VBP actually/RB very/RB tasty/JJ ./. But/CC I/PRP think/VB it/PRP is/VBZ so/RB common/JJ and/CC so/RB cheap/JJ that/IN people/NN overlook/IN it/PRP for/IN the/DT more/JJ sexy/JJ Cashew/NN nuts/NN or/CC Hazelnut/NN ./. But/CC I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ I/PRP am/VBP not/RB the/DT only/RB one/CD who/WP enjoys/VBZ eating/VBG peanuts/NNS ,/, especially/RB the/DT Japanese/NN version/NN where/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ coated/VBN with/IN flour/NN ,/, deep/JJ fried/VBD and/CC laced/VBD with/IN nori/NN ./. Dried/JJ groundnuts/NN must/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN those/DT really/RB addictive/JJ things/NNS that/IN I/PRP NEVER/VB think/VB about/IN eating/VBG these/DT days/NNS unless/. I/PRP am/VBP at/IN a/DT funeral/NN ./. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB why/WRB ./. We/PRP used/VBD to/TO eat/VB them/PRP all/RB the/DT time/NN but/CC I/PRP guess/VBP nowadays/RB I/PRP overlook/VB them/PRP for/IN more/NN sexy/NN stuff/NN ./. Or/CC how/RB about/IN steamed/JJ groundnuts/NN ?/. They/PRP used/VBD the/DT be/VB the/DT best/JJ things/NN to/TO nibble/VB on/IN on/IN a/DT cool/JJ rainy/NN evening/NN ./. Peanuts/NNS are/VBP yummy/JJ and/CC I/PRP daresay/VBP ,/, more/RB yummy/JJ than/IN Brazil/JJ nuts/NN ,/, Almonds/NN ,/, Walnuts/NN and/CC can/MD even/RB give/VB Macadamia/NN nuts/IN a/DT run/NN for/IN the/DT money/NN ./. The/DT only/RB other/JJ nut/IN I/PRP prefer/VBP over/IN peanuts/NNS are/VBP Cashew/JJ nuts/NN ./. When/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO cooking/NN ,/, we/PRP South/NNP East/NNP Asians/. do/VB use/VB a/DT lot/NN of/IN peanuts/NNS ./. They/PRP add/VB that/WDT wonderful/JJ savoury/NN flavor/NN to/TO Chinese/NNP Rojak/NNP ,/, Som/NNP Tam/NNP -LRB-/NNP Thai/NNP Papaya/NNP Salad/NNP -RRB-/NNP ,/, Gado/NNP Gado/NNP and/CC of/IN couse/NN Satay/NN sauce/NN ./. Which/DT brings/NN us/PRP to/TO Satay/NN Bee/NN Hoon/NNS where/WRB the/DT peanut/NN sauce/NN takes/NN centestage/NN ./. Satay/NN Bee/NN Hoon/NN is/VBZ a/DT Teochew/NNP dish/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB hard/JJ to/TO imagine/VB how/WRB it/PRP came/VBD about/IN ./. Obviously/DT some/JJ Teochew/NNP man/NN liked/VBD the/DT peanut/NN gravy/NN that/IN the/DT Malays/NN served/VBD with/IN Satay/NN so/RB much/JJ that/IN he/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO eat/VB more/NN of/IN the/DT gravy/NN and/CC added/VBD it/PRP to/TO Bee/NN Hoon/NN ./. At/IN least/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT story/NN from/IN the/DT stallholder/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB managed/VBN to/TO get/VB any/RB more/JJ details/NNS ./. So/RB if/IN there/EX are/VBP any/DT Satay/NN Bee/NN Hoon/NN experts/NN around/RB ,/, do/VB enlighten/VB us/PRP !/. There/EX are/VBP not/RB many/JJ Satay/NN Bee/NN Hoon/NN stalls/NNS around/IN and/CC I/PRP suspect/VBD that/IN it/PRP might/VBD not/RB be/VB popular/JJ amongst/NN the/DT younger/JJ generation/NN of/IN Singaporeans/NNP ./. My/PRP$ mother/NN absolutely/RB loves/VBZ it/PRP and/CC would/MD join/VB the/DT snaking/JJ queue/NN at/IN East/NNP Coast/NNP Lagoon/NNP whenever/IN she/PRP is/VBZ in/IN town/NN -LRB-/NN She/NN lives/NN in/IN Sydney/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. I/PRP have/VBP always/RB wondered/VBN why/WRB there/EX are/VBP n't/RB any/DT Satay/NN stalls/NNS that/WDT sell/VB Satay/NN Bee/NN Hoon/NN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./. The/DT peanut/NN gravy/NN might/VB be/VB slightly/RB different/JJ -LRB-/NN Satay/NN gravy/NN is/VBZ thicker/JJ -RRB-/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP should/MD n't/RB be/VB too/RB much/JJ of/IN a/DT problem/NN to/TO modify/VB the/DT recipe/NN a/DT little/JJ ./. This/DT stall/NN is/VBZ a/DT branch/NN of/IN the/DT very/RB well/RB known/VBN Satay/NN Bee/NN Hoon/NN Stall/NN at/IN Ang/NNP Mo/NNP Kio/NNP Centre/NN which/WRB many/JJ of/IN our/PRP$ readers/NNS have/VBP told/VBN me/PRP about/IN ./. The/DT gravy/NN is/VBZ well/RB balance/VB in/IN terms/NN of/IN taste/NN but/CC heavier/NN towards/IN the/DT earthy/NN ,/, licorice/NN tones/NN of/IN coriander/NN seeds/NN in/IN flavor/NN ./. The/DT big/JJ difference/NN between/IN the/DT Satay/NN Bee/NN Hoon/NN gravy/NN and/CC the/DT Satay/NN gravy/NN served/VBD in/IN Malay/NN Satay/NN stalls/NN is/VBZ the/DT inclusion/NN of/IN Chinese/NNP Five/CD Spice/NNS in/IN the/DT mix/NN which/WRB gives/VBZ it/PRP a/DT distinctive/NNP Chinese/NNP flavor/NN which/WDT is/VBZ so/RB subtle/JJ that/IN you/PRP might/VB not/RB consciously/RB recognize/VB it/PRP ./. 4.25/DT \//JJ 5/CD Conclusion/NN So/RB are/VBP you/PRP a/DT fan/NN of/IN Satay/NN Bee/NN Hoon/NN ?/. Would/MD you/PRP be/VB Gen/NNP X/NNP ,/, Gen/NNP Y/NNP or/CC Baby/NNP Boomer/NNP ?/.
