<title>Two Fat Men: Most Unlikely place to find Excellent Thai Food!</title>
<text>Here/RB 's/POS a/DT brief/JJ intermission/NN before/IN I/PRP resume/VBD my/PRP$ Ramen/NN Rampage/NN ./. Phew/JJ !/. I/PRP must/VB admit/VB that/WDT I/PRP found/VBD it/PRP hard/RB to/TO believe/VB when/WRB Holydrummer/PRP told/VBD me/PRP how/WRB he/PRP found/VBD this/DT bar/NN that/WDT sold/VBD the/DT best/JJS Thai/NN food/NN he/PRP has/VBZ eaten/VBN since/IN his/PRP$ trip/NN to/TO Bangkok/VB ./. I/PRP have/VB lived/VBD in/IN Bangkok/NN for/IN two/CD years/NNS in/IN early/NN 2000/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN off/IN Thai/JJ food/NN since/IN I/PRP got/VBD back/RB because/IN I/PRP have/VB not/RB found/VBD a/DT Thai/JJ eatery/NN that/WDT would/MD remind/VB me/PRP of/IN the/DT stuff/NN I/PRP used/VBD to/TO eat/VB in/IN any/DT of/IN the/DT non-descript/JJ hole-in-the-wall/NN eateries/NNS that/WDT dot/VBZ the/DT streets/NN of/IN Bangkok/NN ./. So/CC I/PRP have/VBP stopped/VBN eating/VBG Thai/NN food/NN for/IN years/NNS ./. But/CC just/RB to/TO amuse/VB Holydrummer/NN ,/, I/PRP agreed/VBD to/TO meet/VB him/PRP at/IN this/DT bar/NN along/IN East/NNP Coast/NNP Road/NNP for/IN supper/NN ./. He/PRP told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT the/DT place/NN opens/NN from/IN 5pm/JJ to/TO 3am/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP thought/VBD ,/, heck/NN ,/, even/RB if/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ not/RB great/JJ ,/, I/PRP could/MD still/RB blog/VB it/PRP under/IN the/DT supper/NN category/NN ./. But/CC when/WRB the/DT first/JJ dish/NN of/IN Khao/NNP Pad/NNP Krapao/NNP -LRB-/NNP Basil/NNP fried/VBD rice/NN -RRB-/NN come/VB out/VB of/IN the/DT kitchen/NN ,/, all/DT that/WDT changed/NN ./. I/PRP smelled/VB something/NN that/WDT brought/VBN me/PRP back/RB to/TO my/PRP$ favorite/NN hole-in-the-wall/NN in/IN the/DT town/NN of/IN Pak/NN Chong/NN ,/, about/IN a/DT 2/CD hour/NNS drive/RB from/IN Bangkok/NNP !/. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT most/JJ authentic/JJ tasting/VBG Thai/JJ food/NN since/IN I/PRP returned/VBP from/IN Bangkok/VBG more/JJR than/IN 8/CD years/NNS ago/RB !/. When/WRB we/PRP were/VBD living/VBN in/IN Thailand/NN ,/, the/DT food/NN that/WDT we/PRP usually/RB eat/VB is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ different/JJ from/IN what/WP people/NN usually/RB order/NN here/RB ./. We/PRP would/MD go/VB into/IN an/DT eatery/NN and/CC order/NN Khao/IN Pad/NNP Gai/NNP -LRB-/NNP chicken/NN fried/VBD rice/NN -RRB-/NN ,/, Khai/NNP Jiao/NNP Mu/NNP Sap/NNP -LRB-/NNP minced/NNP pork/NN omelette/NN -RRB-/NN ,/, Khao/NNP Niao/NNP -LRB-/NNP Sticky/NNP Rice/NNP -RRB-/NNP ,/, Som/NNP Tam/NNP -LRB-/NNP Papaya/NNP Salad/NNP -RRB-/NNP and/CC Gai/NNP Yang/NNP -LRB-/NNP Grilled/NNP Chicken/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. Yes/EX ,/, they/PRP do/VBP have/VBN green/JJ curry/NN and/CC red/JJ curry/NN ,/, but/CC when/WRB you/PRP stop/VB you/PRP car/NN on/IN the/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT road/NN during/IN a/DT road/NN trip/NN ,/, most/NN of/IN the/DT stall/NN will/MD have/VB Som/VBN Tam/JJ and/CC Khao/JJ Pad/NN Gai/NN ./. You/PRP would/MD need/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN effort/NN to/TO find/VB green/JJ and/CC red/JJ curry/NN ./. So/RB when/WRB I/PRP found/VBD out/IN that/IN you/PRP can/MD actually/RB have/VB Som/JJ Tam/NN with/IN Khao/JJ Niao/NN at/IN Two/NNP Fat/NNP Men/NNP ,/, I/PRP got/VBD very/RB excited/JJ ./. This/DT is/VBZ comfort/JJ food/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT stuff/NN my/PRP$ Thai/NN friends/NNS could/MD eat/VB everyday/NN ./. It/PRP took/VBD me/PRP a/DT while/NN to/TO appreciate/VB it/PRP ,/, but/CC now/RB ,/, I/PRP crave/VBD for/IN it/PRP whenever/IN I/PRP think/VB about/IN Thai/NN food/NN ./. The/DT Som/NN Tam/NN here/RB is/VBZ excellent/JJ ,/, exactly/RB like/VB how/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN Thailand/NN save/NN for/IN the/DT tomaotes/NN ./. 4.5/NNP \//NNP 5/LS ./. If/IN you/PRP want/VBP sticky/VBN rice/NN ,/, you/PRP have/VBP to/TO call/VBP up/RB earlier/JJ so/IN that/WDT they/PRP can/MD prepare/VB it/PRP for/IN you/PRP as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB yet/RB on/IN the/DT menu/NN ./. The/DT combination/NN of/IN sticky/NN rice/NN with/IN Som/NN Tam/NN and/CC grilled/VBN pork/NN collar/NN was/VBD something/NN that/WDT really/RB brought/VBN me/PRP back/RB to/TO the/DT streets/NN of/IN Thailand/NN ./. The/DT two/CD dishes/NNS that/IN I/PRP went/VBD home/NN thinking/VBG about/IN were/VBD the/DT Khaw/JJ Mu/NN Yang/NN -LRB-/RB grilled/VBN pork/NN collar/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC the/DT fried/JJ rice/NN ./. There/EX were/VBD 10/CD of/IN us/PRP having/VBG supper/NN that/IN night/NN after/IN cell/NN group/NN and/CC we/PRP kept/VBD ordering/VBG the/DT Khao/JJ Pad/NN Krapao/NN until/IN they/PRP ran/VB out/VB of/IN Basil/NN ./. So/CC I/PRP told/VBD them/PRP to/TO do/VB a/DT plain/NN old/JJ Khao/NN Pad/NN Gai/NN instead/RB and/CC it/PRP was/VBD still/RB excellent/JJ !/. The/DT fried/VBD rice/NN has/VBZ that/IN wonderful/JJ Wok/NN Hei/NN aroma/NN and/CC I/PRP could/MD n't/RB stop/VB eating/VBG it/PRP ./. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD The/DT Khaw/NN Mu/NN Yang/NN was/VBD the/DT star/NN of/IN the/DT evening/NN though/IN ./. It/PRP was/VBD grilled/VBN and/CC seasoned/JJ to/TO perfection/VB ./. We/PRP had/VBD just/RB had/VBD the/DT Charshu/NN from/IN Santouka/NN for/IN lunch/NN that/IN day/NN ./. The/DT Charshu/NN there/RB was/VBD really/RB excellent/JJ ,/, but/CC this/DT Khaw/JJ Mu/NN Yang/NN had/VBD that/RB extra/JJ KICK/NN on/IN top/NN of/IN being/NN excellent/NN ./. Plus/JJ for/IN about/IN the/DT same/JJ amount/NN of/IN money/NN ,/, you/PRP feel/VB you/PRP can/MD just/RB stuff/NN the/DT pork/NN into/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN rather/RB than/IN slowly/JJ savoring/NN four/IN thin/JJ slices/NNS of/IN Charshu/NN ./. Know/DT what/WP I/PRP mean/VB ?/. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD OK/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO burst/VB your/PRP$ bubble/NN but/CC there/RB were/VBD some/JJ dishes/NNS which/WRB were/VBD quite/RB normal/JJ ./. The/DT fish/NN cake/NN was/VBD a/DT tad/JJ salty/NN 3.75/NN \//NN 5/CD and/CC the/DT Poom/NNP Fy/NNP Daeng/NNP -LRB-/NNP Kangkong/NNP -RRB-/NNP needed/NNP a/DT serious/JJ shot/NN of/IN Umami/NN ./. So/RB ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO give/VB you/PRP the/DT idea/NN that/IN everything/NN here/RB is/VBZ great/JJ ./. The/DT Goong/NNP Ob/NNP Woon/NNP Sen/NNP -LRB-/NNP vermicilli/NNP prawns/NNS -RRB-/RB was/VBD another/DT dish/NN which/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD could/MD be/VB further/RB improved/VBD ./. However/RB ,/, the/DT dishes/NNS that/IN they/PRP did/VBD well/RB was/VBD really/RB very/RB good/JJ ./. Another/DT one/CD is/VBZ the/DT Tom/JJ Yum/NN Goong/NN -LRB-/NN spicy/JJ prawn/NN soup/NN ./. This/DT had/VBD just/RB the/DT right/JJ amount/NN of/IN hot/JJ ,/, sour/JJ and/CC heavily/JJ spiced/NN up/IN taste/NN that/IN a/DT good/JJ Tom/NN Yum/NN is/VBZ supposed/JJ to/TO have/VB ./. Plus/JJ ,/, the/DT soup/NN has/VBZ got/VBN body/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ only/RB obtained/JJ if/IN the/DT chef/NN bothers/VBZ to/TO use/VB a/DT good/JJ seafood/NN stock/NN ./. My/PRP$ wife/NN ,/, who/WP is/VBZ the/DT most/JJ severe/NNP Tom/NNP Yum/NNP Goong/NNP critic/NNP gave/VBD it/PRP her/PRP thumbs/VB up/NN ,/, which/WRB makes/VBZ me/PRP very/RB confident/VBD to/TO give/VB it/PRP a/DT 4.6/NN \//IN 5/CD Being/NN a/DT bar/NN ,/, they/PRP do/VB sell/VB your/PRP$ usual/JJ bar/NN food/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD very/RB pleasantly/JJ surprised/VBD by/IN their/PRP$ burger/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ ,/, no/RB frills/JJ burgers/NNS I/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN for/IN a/DT while/NN ./. The/DT homemade/NN beef/NN pattie/NN was/VBD grilled/VBN to/TO perfection/VB ./. Juicy/JJ and/CC beefy/NN on/IN the/DT inside/NN with/IN a/DT nice/JJ protein/NN crust/NN on/IN the/DT outside/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ served/VBD with/IN just/RB lettuce/NN ,/, onions/NN ,/, tomato/NN and/CC cheese/NN ./. Simple/JJ ingredients/NNS ,/, expertly/RB done/VBN ./. 4.25/DT \//JJ 5/CD Conclusion/NN Two/IN Fat/NNP Men/NNP is/VBZ just/RB a/DT hole-in-the-wall/NN ./. No/JJ kidding/NN ,/, there/RB are/VBP really/RB holes/VB in/IN the/DT wall/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT place/NN where/WRB you/PRP can/MD order/VB a/DT beer/NN and/CC some/NN Thai/NN food/NN or/CC bar/NN food/NN to/TO go/VB with/IN it/PRP and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ opened/VBD till/NN 3am/NN in/IN the/DT morning/NN ./. If/CC it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN a/DT Thai/NN Restaurant/NN and/CC it/PRP would/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ Thai/NN Restaurants/NN in/IN Singapore/NN to/TO serve/VB Thai/NN street/NN food/NN ./. As/CC it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, I/PRP just/RB do/VBP n't/RB know/VB how/WRB to/TO categorize/VB it/PRP except/RB by/IN calling/VBG it/PRP a/DT hole/NN in/IN the/DT wall/NN ./.
