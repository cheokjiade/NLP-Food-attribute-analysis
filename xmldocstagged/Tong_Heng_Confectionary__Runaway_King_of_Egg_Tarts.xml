<title>Tong Heng Confectionary: Runaway King of Egg Tarts</title>
<text>When/WRB you/PRP talk/VB about/IN egg/NN tarts/NNS in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, most/JJ people/NN will/MD point/VB you/PRP to/TO Tong/NNP Heng/NNP Confectionery/NN for/IN their/PRP$ iconic/JJ pastry/NN ./. In/IN our/PRP$ recent/JJ facebook/NN survey/NN ,/, it/PRP comfortably/RB garnered/VB 47/VB out/VB of/IN 90/CD votes/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ quite/RB a/DT feat/NN considering/IN the/DT next/JJ runner/NN up/NN only/RB had/VBD less/JJ than/IN 10/CD votes/NNS !/. I/PRP think/VB Tong/NNP Heng/NNP 's/POS popularity/NN is/VBZ a/DT combination/NN of/IN their/PRP$ long/JJ history/NN in/IN the/DT business/NN as/IN well/RB as/IN the/DT character/NN of/IN their/PRP$ uniquely/NN shaped/JJ egg/NN tarts/NNS which/WRB appeal/VB to/TO a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NN on/IN the/DT subconscious/NN level/NN ./. I/PRP say/VB subconscious/VB because/IN although/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NNS like/IN the/DT egg/NN tarts/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB easy/JJ to/TO say/VB just/RB why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ so/RB appealing/JJ ./. Is/WBZ it/PRP the/DT shape/NN ?/. The/DT texture/NN ?/. The/DT taste/NN ?/. Or/CC is/VBZ it/PRP simply/IN nostalgia/NN as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ something/NN you/PRP grew/VBD up/IN eating/VBG ?/. To/RB find/VB out/IN ,/, I/PRP met/VBD up/RP with/IN Wai/NNP Keong/NNP ,/, a/DT fourth/JJ generation/NN family/NN member/NN of/IN the/DT shop/NN who/WP also/RB happens/VBZ to/TO be/VB one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ makan/NN kakis/NNS ./. Tong/NNP Heng/NNP Confectionery/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT oldest/JJ confectioneries/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP and/CC it/PRP specializes/VBD in/IN Cantonese/NNP pastries/NNP ./. It/PRP is/VBZ ironic/JJ though/IN ,/, that/CC almost/RB all/DT their/PRP$ pastries/NNS are/VBP traditionally/RB Cantonese/JJ except/NN for/IN their/PRP$ egg/NN tarts/NNS which/WRB has/VBZ its/PRP$ roots/JJ from/IN either/VBG the/DT British/NNP -LRB-/NNP Hong/NNP Kong/NNP -RRB-/NNP or/CC Portuguese/NNP -LRB-/NNP Macau/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. According/VBG to/TO Wai/NNP Keong/NNP ,/, Tong/NNP Heng/NNP is/VBZ 88/CD years/NNS old/RB this/DT year/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD 88/RB last/JJ year/NN and/CC will/VB be/VB 88/JJ next/JJ year/NN ./. The/DT truth/NN is/VBZ no/RB one/CD really/RB knows/JJ ./. However/RB ,/, we/PRP do/VB know/VB that/WDT his/PRP$ great/JJ grandfather/NNP Fong/NNP Chee/NN Heng/NNP arrived/VBD in/IN Singapore/NNP around/IN 1901/NN as/IN a/DT coolie/NN and/CC eventually/RB saved/VB up/IN enough/JJ to/TO start/VB his/PRP$ pushcart/NN kopi/IN business/NNP 1920/NNP 's/POS ./. By/CC the/DT 1930/NN 's/POS ,/, he/PRP opened/VBD his/PRP$ own/JJ coffeeshop/NN at/IN 33/NNP ,/, Smith/NNP Street/NNP selling/VBG kopi/NN and/CC kaya/NN toast/NN as/IN well/RB as/IN other/JJ homemade/NN pastries/NN ./. The/DT egg/NN tart/NN has/VBZ taken/VBN on/IN various/NN shapes/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB until/IN the/DT 1960/NN 's/POS that/WDT it/PRP finally/RB settled/VBD on/IN the/DT iconic/JJ diamond/NN shaped/NN form/NN ./. At/IN the/DT time/NN ,/, the/DT egg/NN tarts/NNS were/VBD just/RB another/JJ item/NN that/WDT was/VBD served/VBN at/IN the/DT coffeeshop/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD far/JJ from/IN being/VBG the/DT pastry/NN that/WDT would/MD eventually/RB come/VB to/IN be/VB identified/VBD with/IN Tong/NNP Heng/NNP ./. The/DT breakthrough/NN come/VBN in/IN the/DT late/JJ 70/NN 's/POS when/WRB Wai/NNP Keong/NNP 's/POS grandfather/NN left/JJ the/DT coffeeshop/NN for/IN the/DT day/NN ./. His/PRP daughter/NNP -LRB-/NNP Wai/NNP Keong/NNP 's/POS aunt/NN -RRB-/NN took/VBD the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO erect/VB a/DT glass/JJ showcase/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT coffeeshop/NN and/CC started/VBD displaying/VBG the/DT egg/NN tarts/NNS ./. It/PRP had/VBD to/TO be/VB done/VBN when/WRB grandfather/NN was/VBD away/RB because/IN he/PRP would/MD never/RB have/VB approved/VBN it/PRP ./. That/DT was/VBD the/DT day/NN that/IN Tong/NNP Heng/NNP morphed/NNP from/IN a/DT coffeeshop/NN to/TO a/DT confectionery/NN !/. People/PRP started/VBD lining/VBG up/RP outside/IN the/DT coffeeshop/NN for/IN their/PRP$ egg/NN tarts/NNS and/CC very/RB soon/RB it/PRP was/VBD the/DT talk/VB of/IN the/DT town/NN ./. So/RB what/WP makes/VBZ Tong/NNP Heng/NNP 's/POS egg/NN tarts/NNS so/RB appealing/JJ ?/. Well/RB ,/, there/RB are/VBP several/JJ factors/NNS ./. One/CD thing/NN you/PRP will/MD notice/VB about/IN the/DT egg/NN tart/NN is/VBZ that/IN their/PRP$ pastry/NN base/NN is/VBZ not/RB easy/JJ to/TO define/VB ./. It/PRP is/VBZ neither/JJ puff/NN pastry/NN nor/VBZ a/DT shortcrust/JJ pastry/NN but/CC a/DT combination/NN of/IN both/DT ./. The/DT dough/NN starts/NNS off/IN as/IN a/DT traditional/JJ two/CD part/NN flaky/JJ pastry/NN that/WDT is/VBZ typical/JJ for/IN chinese/JJ biscuits/NNS like/IN Tau/NNP Sar/NNP Piah/NNP ./. This/DT flaky/JJ dough/NN is/VBZ made/VBD by/IN layering/VBG a/DT lard/NN based/VBD dough/NN over/IN a/DT water/NN based/VBD dough/NN which/WDT results/VBD in/IN the/DT familiar/JJ flaky/JJ pastry/NN that/WDT is/VBZ unique/RB to/TO Chinese/NNP style/NN biscuits/NN ./. This/DT dough/NN is/VBZ then/RB pressed/JJ onto/IN the/DT diamond/JJ shaped/NN mold/NN ensuring/NN that/IN the/DT base/NN is/VBZ as/RB thin/JJ as/IN possible/JJ while/NN maintaining/IN a/DT nice/JJ rim/NN of/IN pastry/NN at/IN the/DT edge/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT egg/NN filling/NN does/VBZ not/RB spill/VB out/IN ./. This/DT second/NN step/NN essentially/RB turns/VBZ the/DT dough/NN into/IN a/DT unique/JJ hybrid/NN of/IN shortcrust/JJ and/CC flaky/JJ pastry/NN !/. The/DT diamond/NN shape/NN also/RB plays/VBZ a/DT big/JJ role/NN in/IN its/PRP$ appeal/NN ./. Because/JJ of/IN its/PRP$ shape/JJ ,/, most/JJ people/NN will/MD pick/VB up/IN the/DT pastry/NN in/IN their/PRP$ hands/NN with/IN their/PRP$ thumb/NN and/CC three/CD fingers/NNS and/CC the/DT most/JJ natural/JJ way/NN of/IN eating/VBG the/DT tart/NN would/MD be/VB to/TO start/VB with/IN the/DT sharper/NN edge/NN first/JJ and/CC ending/JJ with/IN the/DT opposite/JJ edge/NN ./. This/DT means/NN that/IN you/PRP start/VB and/CC end/VB with/IN the/DT nice/JJ crunch/VB of/IN the/DT pastry/NN and/CC enjoy/VB the/DT wobbly/JJ custard/NN and/CC thin/JJ base/NN in/IN between/IN !/. Now/JJ to/TO the/DT egg/NN custard/NN ./. Tong/NNP Heng/NNP has/VBZ a/DT very/RB simple/JJ philosophy/NN for/IN the/DT egg/NN custard/NN and/CC that/WDT is/VBZ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO taste/VB fresh/JJ eggs/NN when/WRB you/PRP eat/VB the/DT tart/NN ./. To/RB do/VB this/DT ,/, they/PRP work/VB with/IN a/DT local/JJ egg/NN farm/NN who/WP have/VBZ designated/VBN a/DT section/NN of/IN their/PRP$ farm/NN specially/RB to/TO produce/VB eggs/NN for/IN their/PRP$ egg/NN tarts/NNS ./. These/DT chickens/NNS are/VBP fed/VBN with/IN a/DT special/JJ ,/, all/DT natural/JJ feed/VB and/CC must/VB be/VB not/RB come/VB from/IN hens/NN which/WDT are/VBP too/RB old/JJ ./. They/PRP also/RB tell/VB me/PRP that/WDT the/DT eggs/NN must/RB be/VB cracked/JJ within/NN 48/NN hours/NNS from/IN the/DT time/NN they/PRP are/VBP laid/JJ since/IN the/DT freshness/NN of/IN the/DT egg/NN will/MD determine/VB the/DT texture/NN of/IN the/DT custard/NN ./. They/PRP are/VBP so/RB meticulous/JJ about/IN the/DT egg/NN custard/NN that/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN breaking/VBG the/DT eggs/NN can/MD only/RB be/VB done/VBN by/IN one/CD particular/JJ aunt/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ said/JJ that/IN she/PRP has/VBZ handled/VBD so/RB many/JJ eggs/NNS that/IN she/PRP knows/VBD how/RB old/JJ the/DT hen/NN is/VBZ just/RB by/IN feeling/VBG the/DT egg/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD very/RB intrigued/JJ by/IN this/DT ,/, so/RB I/PRP asked/VBD the/DT aunt/NN what/WP was/VBD the/DT secret/NN ./. ``/VB Its/PRP no/DT secret/NN lah/PRP ''/NN ,/, she/PRP told/VBD me/PRP ./. ``/. The/DT older/NN the/DT chicken/NN ,/, the/DT bigger/JJR the/DT eggs/NN !/. ''/RB Ah/NN ,/, so/RB !/. The/DT reason/NN the/DT eggs/NN can/MD not/RB come/VB from/IN older/NNP hens/NNP is/VBZ very/RB simple/JJ ./. It/PRP has/VBZ more/JJR to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT eggs/NN than/IN the/DT quality/NN ./. Being/VBG a/DT traditional/JJ confectionery/NN ,/, their/PRP$ recipe/NN for/IN the/DT egg/NN custard/NN is/VBZ based/VBD on/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN eggs/NN per/NN pot/NN of/IN sugar/NN syrup/NN ./. So/CC the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT egg/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB consistently/NN between/IN 50/CD to/TO 55g/VB ./. Old/NNP mother/NNP hen/NNP eggs/NNP may/MD be/VB 60-60g/VBN in/IN which/WDT case/NN the/DT consistency/NN of/IN the/DT egg/NN custard/NN would/MD be/VB more/RB firm/JJ and/CC long/JJ time/NN customers/NN will/MD start/VB complaining/RB !/. The/DT last/JJ thing/NN you/PRP need/VB to/TO know/VB about/IN the/DT custard/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ made/VBD only/RB with/IN three/CD ingredients/NNS ,/, viz/NNP eggs/NN ,/, water/NN and/CC sugar/NN ./. Unlike/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN other/JJ places/NNS who/WP may/MD use/VB thickeners/NNS like/IN custard/NN powder/NN or/CC corn/NN flour/NN ,/, theirs/NN is/VBZ a/DT pure/JJ egg/NN custard/NN ./. So/RB what/WP you/PRP taste/VBP is/VBZ essentially/RB sweetened/VBD eggs/NN !/. This/DT type/NN of/IN egg/NN custard/NN is/VBZ very/RB similar/JJ to/TO Chawanmushi/VB which/WDT is/VBZ essentially/RB a/DT custard/NN of/IN beaten/VBN eggs/NN in/IN dashi/NN in/IN the/DT proportion/NN of/IN 1/CD part/NN egg/NN to/TO 4/CD parts/NNS water/NN ./. Conclusion/NN The/DT Egg/NN Tarts/NN at/IN Tong/NNP Heng/NNP are/VBP indeed/RB very/RB unique/JJ and/CC its/PRP$ no/RB wonder/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB the/DT most/NN popular/JJ egg/NN tarts/NNS amongst/NN our/PRP$ readers/NNS !/. This/DT is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ Singapore/NNP institution/NNP which/WDT ,/, thankfully/NN ,/, will/VB be/VB around/RB for/IN at/IN least/RB another/DT generation/NN !/.
