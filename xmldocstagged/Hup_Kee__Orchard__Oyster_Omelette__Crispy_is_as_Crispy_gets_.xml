<title>Hup Kee (Orchard) Oyster Omelette: Crispy is as Crispy gets!</title>
<text>Which/DT bit/NN of/IN the/DT Oyster/NN Omelette/NN is/VBZ your/JJ favorite/NN ?/. Is/WBZ it/PRP the/DT oyster/NN ,/, the/DT egg/NN or/CC the/DT sticky/JJ sweet/JJ potato/NN paste/NN ?/. For/IN me/PRP it/PRP 's/POS the/DT sticky/NN paste/NN ./. Ok/JJ ,/, call/VBP me/PRP an/DT Oyster/JJ Omelette/NN ignoramus/NN but/CC when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD young/JJ I/PRP never/RB liked/VBD oysters/NN or/CC cockles/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP grew/VBD up/IN just/RB eating/VBG the/DT sticky/NN paste/NN with/IN the/DT egg/NN ./. I/PRP guess/VB I/PRP just/RB developed/VBN a/DT liking/VBG for/IN it/PRP ./. So/CC the/DT main/JJ things/NN for/IN me/PRP is/VBZ the/DT fried/JJ eggs/NN and/CC sticky/NN paste/NN and/CC the/DT oysters/NNS are/VBP a/DT side/NN issue/NN ./. Do/VBP n't/RB you/PRP think/VB fried/VBD eggs/NNS are/VBP one/CD of/IN those/DT things/NN we/PRP tend/VBD to/TO take/VB for/IN granted/VBD ?/. You/PRP only/RB realize/VB how/RB yummy/JJ a/DT simple/JJ omelette/NN can/MD be/VB when/WRB you/PRP are/VBP out/RP in/IN the/DT jungle/NN during/IN reservist/NN training/NN and/CC someone/NN starts/NNS frying/VBG some/DT eggs/NN ./. I/PRP remember/VBP having/VBG a/DT craving/NN for/IN eggs/NN during/IN the/DT Bird/JJ Flu/NN epidemic/IN some/JJ years/NNS back/RB ./. Somehow/NNP Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP just/RB does/VBZ not/RB taste/VB the/DT same/JJ without/IN the/DT eggs/NN ./. This/DT Oyster/NN Omelette/NN is/VBZ quite/RB well/RB known/VBN and/CC is/VBZ one/CD of/IN those/DT stalls/NNS where/WRB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT perpetual/JJ queue/NN outside/NN ./. However/RB ,/, there/RB have/VB been/VBN some/JJ mixed/VBD reviews/NNS about/IN the/DT stall/NN ./. I/PRP liked/VBD the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT eggs/NN and/CC the/DT sweet/JJ potato/NN flour/NN was/VBD fried/VBN till/NN it/PRP was/VBD really/RB crispy/JJ ./. The/DT oysters/NN were/VBD also/RB quite/RB plump/JJ and/CC tasted/VBD quite/RB fresh/JJ ./. Quite/RB good/JJ but/CC I/PRP felt/VBD it/PRP was/VBD missing/JJ something/NN ./. Somehow/JJ ,/, franchised/VBN hawker/NN joints/NN just/RB can/MD not/RB beat/VB the/DT solo/JJ hawker/NN joints/NN especially/RB when/WRB the/DT dish/NN is/VBZ operator/JJ dependent/NN ./. Still/DT its/PRP$ an/DT Oyster/JJ Omelette/NN that/WDT is/VBZ better/JJR then/RB most/JJ out/IN there/RB ./. </text>
