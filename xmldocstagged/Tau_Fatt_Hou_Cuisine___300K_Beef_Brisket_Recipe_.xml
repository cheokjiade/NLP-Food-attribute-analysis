<title>Tau Fatt Hou Cuisine: $300K Beef Brisket Recipe!</title>
<text>I/PRP just/RB realized/VB how/RB much/RB I/PRP love/VBP Ngou/JJ Lam/NNP Meen/NNP -LRB-/NNP Beef/NNP Brisket/NNP Noodles/NNP -RRB-/NNP !/. But/CC you/PRP know/VBP ,/, there/RB is/VBZ n't/RB that/IN many/JJ famous/JJ Hawker/NN Stalls/NN around/IN where/WRB you/PRP can/MD find/VB this/DT dish/NN nowadays/RB ./. I/PRP suspect/VB it/PRP is/VBZ because/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN beef/NN has/VBZ gone/VBN up/IN so/RB much/JJ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ too/RB expensive/JJ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO serve/VB a/DT decent/JJ plate/NN of/IN Ngou/NN Lam/NN Meen/NN for/IN $/$ 3/CD or/CC $/$ 4/CD ./. So/RB we/PRP end/VB up/VB eating/VBG this/DT dish/JJ either/NN in/IN the/DT ``/JJ Kitchens/NN ''/NN of/IN Crystal/NNP Jade/NNP or/CC Imperial/NNP Treasure/NNP ./. That/DT is/VBZ such/RB a/DT shame/NN since/IN this/DT dish/NN can/MD be/VB so/RB good/JJ especially/RB when/WRB there/EX are/VBP lots/RB of/IN tendons/NN that/WDT have/VBN been/VBN stewed/VBN till/NN they/PRP are/VBP wonderfully/JJ sticky/NN and/CC collageny/RB good/JJ !/. The/DT secret/NN to/TO a/DT Ngou/JJ Lam/NN ,/, aside/NN from/IN the/DT secret/NN recipe/NN ,/, is/VBZ the/DT cut/NN of/IN beef/NN used/VBD in/IN the/DT stew/NN ./. Traditionally/JJ ,/, it/PRP should/MD be/VB Beef/NN Brisket/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT beef/NN that/WDT is/VBZ equivalent/JJ to/TO pork/NN belly/NN ./. The/DT meat/NN here/RB is/VBZ tough/JJ and/CC the/DT layers/NNS are/VBP separated/VBN by/IN connective/NN tissue/NN and/CC fats/NNS so/IN you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB eat/VB it/PRP as/IN a/DT steak/NN ,/, but/CC when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ slow/JJ cooked/VBN in/IN a/DT stew/NN ,/, all/NN that/IN connective/JJ tissue/NN breaks/NN down/NN into/IN lots/NNS of/IN flavor/NN and/CC enticing/NN texture/NN !/. Some/DT places/NNS serve/VB Ngou/RB Lam/RB using/VBG cuts/NNS of/IN beef/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT other/JJ cuts/NNS just/RB ca/MD n't/RB compare/VB to/TO brisket/VB ./. The/DT stall/NN here/RB uses/VBZ only/RB Beef/NN Brisket/NN to/TO make/VB their/PRP$ Ngou/NNP Lam/NNP ./. They/PRP used/VBD to/TO serve/VB tendon/NN as/IN well/RB ,/, but/CC nowadays/RB ,/, the/DT price/NN of/IN tendon/NN has/VBZ skyrocketed/RB ,/, so/IN they/PRP ca/MD n't/RB afford/VB to/TO sell/VB tendon/RB anymore/RB which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ shame/NN ./. The/DT gravy/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ and/CC the/DT beef/NN has/VBZ a/DT wonderful/JJ beefy/NN ,/, five/CD spice/NN flavor/NN about/IN it/PRP that/RB got/VBD all/DT our/JJ kakis/NNS raving/VBG from/IN the/DT first/JJ mouthful/NN !/. Everyone/DT was/VBD chewing/NN on/IN the/DT beef/NN holding/VBG their/PRP$ chopsticks/NNS in/IN the/DT right/JJ hand/NN and/CC showing/VBD a/DT thumbs-up/NN with/IN the/DT left/JJ !/. Mr/NNP Wong/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN running/IN the/DT stall/NN for/IN the/DT last/JJ 30/CD years/NNS but/CC it/PRP was/VBD only/RB in/IN the/DT last/JJ 6/CD years/NNS or/RB so/RB that/IN he/PRP started/VBD focusing/VBG on/IN Ngou/NNP Lam/NNP Noodles/NNP ./. The/DT stall/NN 's/POS original/JJ signature/JJ dish/NN was/VBD the/DT Rose/NNP Wine/NNP Chicken/NNP noodle/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT dish/JJ shown/NN on/IN the/DT logo/NN ./. His/PRP boast/VBD about/IN his/PRP$ Ngou/JJ Lam/NN recipe/NN being/NN worth/NN $/$ 300K/CD is/VBZ n't/RB something/NN that/WDT he/PRP just/RB plucked/VB out/IN of/IN thin/JJ air/NN ./. Mr/NNP Wong/NNP tells/VBZ me/PRP that/WDT there/EX have/VBN indeed/RB been/VBN potential/JJ investors/NN who/WP have/VBN been/VBN discussing/VBG with/IN him/PRP about/IN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN franchising/NN his/PRP$ Ngou/JJ Lam/NN Noodles/NN and/CC that/WDT was/VBD the/DT price/NN being/NN negotiated/NN for/IN his/PRP$ recipe/NN !/. Conclusion/NN So/NN was/VBD the/DT Ngou/JJ Lam/NN recipe/NN worth/NN $/$ 300K/CD ?/. Well/RB ,/, only/RB an/DT investor/NN can/MD tell/VB you/PRP that/RB ,/, but/CC for/IN me/PRP it/PRP was/VBD the/DT best/JJS Ngou/NNP Lam/NNP Meen/. I/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN for/IN a/DT long/JJ while/NN ,/, so/IN its/PRP$ definitely/RB worth/IN the/DT trip/NN and/CC the/DT $/$ 4.50/CD I/PRP paid/VBD for/IN lunch/NN !/. The/DT stall/NN is/VBZ now/RB closed/VBD ./. They/PRP are/VBP moving/VBG to/TO Blk/NNP 127/NNP Bukit/NNP Merah/NNP Lane/. 1/CD ,/, #/SYM 01-230/CD ,/, Singapore/NNP 150127/NNP from/IN the/DT middle/JJ of/IN November/NNP 2012/NNP !/.
