<title>Punggol Noodles: Mighty Meatballs!</title>
<text>Fans/DT of/IN Punggol/NNP noodles/NNS might/VB be/VB wondering/VBG where/WRB they/PRP relocated/VBD too/RB after/IN the/DT re-opening/NN of/IN Kovan/NN Food/NN Centre/NN ./. Well/RB ,/, they/PRP have/VBN just/RB moved/VBD to/TO the/DT coffeeshop/NN down/IN the/DT road/NN .../: ./. ./. in/IN case/NN you/PRP are/VBP really/RB wondering/VBG ./. With/IN so/RB many/JJ good/JJ Bak/NNP Chor/NNP Mee/NNP around/IN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ getting/VBG harder/NN and/CC harder/NN for/IN me/PRP to/TO say/VB something/NN interesting/JJ about/IN Bak/NNP Chor/NNP Mee/NNP since/IN I/PRP have/VBP probably/RB already/RB said/JJ it/PRP in/IN an/DT earlier/JJ post/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRP am/VBP not/RB old/JJ enough/JJ to/TO come/VB across/IN as/IN a/DT person/NN who/WP keeps/VBZ repeating/IN the/DT same/JJ story/NN again/RB and/CC again/RB ,/, either/NN because/IN I/PRP have/VBP simply/VBN forgotten/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP already/RB said/JJ it/PRP or/CC that/WDT I/PRP really/RB have/VB nothing/NN new/JJ to/TO say/VB and/CC so/RB I/PRP have/VBN to/TO do/VB re-runs/RB ./. But/CC thankfully/RB there/RB are/VBP some/JJ interesting/JJ new/JJ things/NNS that/IN I/PRP can/MD talk/VB about/IN Punggol/NNP Noodles/NNP ,/, so/RB you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO hear/VB the/DT same/JJ story/NN again/RB and/CC again/RB ,/, either/NN because/IN I/PRP have/VBP simply/VBN forgotten/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP already/RB said/JJ it/PRP or/CC .../: Well/RB ,/, there/RB are/VBP actually/RB three/CD things/NNS that/WDT make/VB Punggol/NNP Noodles/NN stand/VB out/VB from/IN the/DT rest/NN ./. The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ that/IN the/DT hawker/NN is/VBZ a/DT really/RB nice/JJ guy/NN who/WP literally/VBZ cooks/RB single/JJ handed/NN ./. Having/VBG lost/. his/PRP$ right/JJ hand/NN in/IN an/DT industrial/JJ accident/NN ,/, this/DT hawker/NN uncle/NN never/RB let/VB his/PRP handicap/NN get/VB in/IN the/DT way/NN of/IN making/VBG a/DT great/JJ bowl/NN of/IN bak/NN chor/NN mee/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ hard/JJ not/RB to/TO mention/VB this/DT since/IN it/PRP is/VBZ his/PRP$ distinguishing/JJ feature/NN ,/, much/RB like/IN the/DT legend/NN of/IN the/DT crippled/NNP Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP man/NN of/IN Serangoon/NN ./. The/DT highlight/VB of/IN this/DT bowl/NN of/IN noodle/NN for/IN me/PRP is/VBZ the/DT meatballs/NN ./. So/RB technically/JJ ,/, you/PRP should/MD not/RB call/VBP this/DT Bak/NNP Chor/NNP -LRB-/NNP Minced/NNP Meat/NNP -RRB-/NNP Mee/NNP ,/, but/CC Bak/NNP Yee/NNP -LRB-/NNP Meatball/NNP -RRB-/NNP Mee/NNP ./. Whatever/WP you/PRP call/VBP it/PRP ,/, the/DT balls/NNS are/VBP excellent/JJ ./. They/PRP are/VBP soft/JJ ,/, tender/JJ and/CC yet/RB has/VB that/IN bounciness/NN about/IN it/PRP that/WDT makes/VBZ it/PRP different/JJ from/IN the/DT ones/NNS you/PRP might/VB eat/VB at/IN home/NN ./. They/PRP are/VBP reminiscent/JJ of/IN the/DT Teochew/NNP Style/NNP Bak/NNP Yee/NNP -LRB-/NNP Meat/NNP Balls/NNP -RRB-/NN which/WRB you/PRP can/MD order/VB at/IN Teochew/NNP Muay/NNP stalls/NNS ./. Hidden/DT within/JJ each/JJ ball/NN is/VBZ savoury/JJ goodness/NN that/IN stems/NN from/IN the/DT generous/JJ use/VB of/IN Ti/NNP Poh/NNP -LRB-/. deep/VB fried/VBD sole/NN fish/NN -RRB-/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBP yet/RB to/TO taste/VB anything/NN with/IN enough/JJ Ti/NNP Poh/NNP in/IN it/PRP that/WDT is/VBZ mediocre/RB ./. Like/JJ parmesan/NN cheese/NN and/CC truffle/NN oil/NN ,/, it/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO lift/VB the/DT taste/NN of/IN whatever/PRP you/PRP add/VB it/PRP to/TO ./. The/DT other/JJ item/NN that/IN they/PRP serve/VBP here/RB which/WDT is/VBZ supposed/JJ to/TO be/VB good/JJ is/VBZ the/DT Seh/NNP Tng/NNP -LRB-/NNP Fallopian/NNP tubes/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. These/DT are/VBP braised/VBN in/IN a/DT slow/JJ cooker/NN together/RB with/IN the/DT mushrooms/NNS and/CC forms/VBD the/DT sauce/NN base/NN for/IN the/DT noodles/NNS ./. I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT big/JJ fan/NN of/IN Fallopian/NN tubes/NN ./. Most/JJS of/IN the/DT time/NN whenever/IN I/PRP come/VB across/IN Fallopian/NN tubes/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD refer/VB to/TO the/DT Gynaecologist/NN ./. But/CC my/PRP$ friend/NN Cactuskit/NN ,/, who/WP loves/VBZ Fallopian/RB tubes/JJ -LRB-/NN he/PRP has/VBZ four/JJ kids/NNS -RRB-/RB tell/VB me/PRP that/WDT the/DT Seh/NN Tng/NN here/RB is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ./. Chewy/DT on/IN the/DT outside/NN and/CC sort/NN of/IN powdery/NN pastey/NN on/IN the/DT inside/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB something/NN I/PRP look/VB forward/VB to/TO eating/NN ./. I/PRP would/MD love/VB to/TO tell/VB you/PRP that/WDT the/DT noodles/NNS and/CC the/DT sauce/NN were/VBD also/RB excellent/JJ ,/, but/CC they/PRP are/VBP n't/RB ./. I/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN there/RB on/IN three/CD separate/NN occasions/NNS and/CC each/JJ time/NN I/PRP left/VBN feeling/VBG that/IN the/DT limp/JJ noodles/NNS where/WRB just/RB a/DT one/CD off/IN ./. Even/RB after/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ visit/NN ,/, I/PRP still/RB left/VBN feeling/VBG that/WDT he/PRP must/VB be/VB able/JJ to/TO do/VB better/NN ./. How/WRB else/RB could/VB they/PRP have/VBN gotten/IN six/CD chopsticks/NNS on/IN the/DT Makansutra/NN guide/NN ?/. Conclusion/NN I/PRP have/VBP a/DT niggling/NN feeling/VBG that/IN the/DT noodles/NNS must/VB be/VB better/RBR given/VBN the/DT amount/NN of/IN passion/NN the/DT hawker/NN uncle/NN puts/VBZ into/IN his/PRP$ craft/NN ./. If/IN the/DT noodles/NNS were/VBD as/RB good/JJ as/IN his/PRP$ meatballs/NN ,/, he/PRP would/MD have/VB scored/VBD a/DT ``/NN really/RB must/VB try/VB ''/RB from/IN me/PRP ./. But/CC as/IN such/JJ I/PRP can/MD only/RB give/VB him/PRP a/DT ./.
