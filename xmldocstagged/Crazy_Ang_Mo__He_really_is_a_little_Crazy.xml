<title>Crazy Ang Mo: He really is a little Crazy</title>
<text>Khim/DT was/VBD the/DT first/JJ to/TO tell/VB me/PRP about/IN this/DT new/JJ Ang/NNP Moh/NNP Hawker/NNP in/IN Bishan/NNP when/WRB they/PRP first/RB opened/VBD months/NNS ago/RB ./. A/DT few/JJ days/NNS after/IN she/PRP raved/VBN about/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, she/PRP went/VBD back/RB again/RB and/CC reported/VB that/IN her/PRP second/JJ visit/NN was/VBD n't/RB as/IN rosy/NN ./. So/CC I/PRP kept/VB it/PRP on/IN the/DT shelf/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN ./. Then/RB the/DT reviews/NNS started/VBD coming/VBG in/IN the/DT forums/NN comparing/VBG them/PRP with/IN the/DT other/JJ Ang/NNP Moh/NNP Hawker/NNP ,/, Botak/NNP Jones/NNP --/NNP and/CC Crazy/NNP Ang/NNP Moh/NNP came/VBD up/IN short/NN ./. So/CC I/PRP thought/VBD that/IN that/PRP was/VBD the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT line/NN and/CC that/IN this/DT Ang/JJ Moh/NN in/IN the/DT Heartlands/NN was/VBD not/RB going/VBG to/TO appear/VB in/IN the/DT blog/NN ./. But/CC then/RB I/PRP heard/VBN a/DT bit/NN more/NN about/IN this/DT ``/JJ Crazy/NNP ''/NNP Ang/NNP Moh/NNP going/NN around/IN with/IN a/DT loud/JJ hailer/NN ,/, organizing/NN ice/NN cream/NN eating/NN competitions/NN for/IN the/DT kids/NNS and/CC even/RB praying/VB for/IN one/CD particular/JJ old/JJ man/NN with/IN a/DT frozen/JJ shoulder/NN ./. -LRB-/. The/DT old/JJ man/NN apparently/NN came/VBD back/RB the/DT next/JJ day/NN exuberant/NN that/IN his/PRP$ shoulder/NN was/VBD healed/RB !/. -RRB-/RB On/JJ top/NN of/IN that/WDT ,/, I/PRP heard/VBN they/PRP actually/RB served/VBD true/JJ blue/JJ Aussie/NN tucker/NN -LRB-/NN food/NN -RRB-/NN ./. So/CC I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD interesting/JJ enough/JJ to/TO go/VB see/VB just/RB how/RB crazy/JJ this/DT particular/JJ Ang/NNP Moh/NNP really/RB is/VBZ ./. When/WRB I/PRP was/VBD a/DT medical/NN student/NN in/IN Sydney/NN ,/, my/PRP$ favorite/JJ Aussie/NN food/NN were/VBD meat/NN pies/NNS ,/, fish/NN and/CC chips/NNS and/CC Burgers/NNS ./. What/WP makes/VBZ an/DT Aussie/JJ Burger/NNP different/JJ is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP add/VB a/DT slice/NN of/IN Beetroot/NN to/TO the/DT burger/NN to/TO give/VB it/PRP that/IN tangy/NN sweet/JJ taste/NN ./. Takes/RB a/DT bit/NN of/IN getting/VBG used/VBD to/TO ,/, but/CC it/PRP actually/RB does/VBZ grow/RB on/IN you/PRP ./. So/CC I/PRP was/VBD really/RB happy/JJ to/TO find/VB that/IN Crazy/NNP Ang/NNP Moh/NNP served/VBD up/IN an/DT Aussie/NNP Burger/NNP with/IN the/DT Beetroot/NN as/IN well/RB as/IN a/DT slice/NN of/IN pineapple/NN ,/, sunny/NN side/NN up/IN egg/NN and/CC cheese/NN for/IN $/$ 7.90/CD ./. The/DT pineapple/NN and/CC beetroot/NN gave/VBD the/DT burger/NN a/DT sweetish/JJ tingle/NN which/WDT I/PRP really/RB enjoy/VB ./. -LRB-/DT Same/JJ reason/NN why/WRB I/PRP like/VB Sweet/NNP and/CC Sour/NNP Pork/NNP -RRB-/NNP ,/, though/IN I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN the/DT meat/NN was/VBD ground/JJ too/RB fine/JJ and/CC was/VBD a/DT little/JJ over/IN spiced/NN with/IN Oregano/NN ./. I/PRP reckon/VBD with/IN a/DT bit/NN of/IN tweaking/NN with/IN the/DT pattie/NN and/CC this/DT burger/NN could/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT really/RB good/JJ and/CC cheap/JJ burgers/NNS in/IN town/NN ./. -LRB-/. But/CC you/PRP 'll/VB have/VB to/TO learn/VB to/TO appreciate/VB beetroot/NN -RRB-/NN Now/RB ,/, the/DT Burger/NNP was/VBD close/JJ to/TO a/DT Fair/JJ Dinkum/NN -LRB-/NN true/JJ blue/JJ -RRB-/NNP Aussie/NNP Burger/NNP but/CC I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB say/VB the/DT same/JJ for/IN the/DT fish/NN and/CC chips/NNS ./. I/PRP have/VBP never/RB seen/JJ bits/NNS of/IN herb/NN in/IN the/DT batter/NN anywhere/NN in/IN Australia/NNP ./. They/PRP use/VB cream/NN dory/NN here/RB which/WRB sometimes/RB can/MD taste/VB a/DT little/JJ muddy/NN ./. There/EX are/VBP lots/RB of/IN very/RB competent/JJ hawker/NN fish/NN and/CC chips/NNS around/IN and/CC this/DT one/CD just/NN fails/NN to/TO stand/VB out/IN amongst/NN all/NN of/IN them/PRP ./. I/PRP guess/VB by/IN using/VBG a/DT fish/NN that/WDT is/VBZ more/RB traditionally/RB Aussie/JJ like/IN Hake/NN would/MD drive/VB the/DT price/NN up/NN ,/, but/CC at/IN least/RB it/PRP would/MD differentiate/VB them/PRP from/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT local/JJ hawker/NN western/NN food/NN ./. I/PRP for/IN one/CD would/MD love/VB to/TO eat/VB a/DT fish/NN and/CC chips/NNS that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB have/VB any/DT kind/NN of/IN Dory/NNP in/IN it/PRP !/. The/DT man/NN behind/IN the/DT fryer/NN is/VBZ Tennis/JJ Coach/NN and/CC Wollongong/NN boy/NN ,/, Paul/NN Crinis/NN who/WP came/VBD to/TO Singapore/NNP on/IN a/DT whim/NN to/TO teach/VB Tennis/NN ./. He/PRP then/RB met/VBD one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ lovely/RB Singaporean/JJ girls/NN and/CC decided/VBD to/TO stay/VB a/DT little/JJ longer/RB ./. When/WRB she/PRP brought/VBN him/PRP home/NN to/TO meet/VB Mom/NN ,/, he/PRP was/VBD so/RB loud/JJ that/IN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT visit/NN ,/, she/PRP started/VBD calling/VBG him/PRP the/DT Crazy/NNP Ang/NNP Moh/NNP ./. Now/RB she/PRP has/VBZ a/DT Crazy/JJ Ang/JJ Moh/NN as/IN a/DT son-in-law/NN and/CC even/RB a/DT half/JJ Ang/NNP Moh/NNP granddaughter/NNP ./. I/PRP must/VB admit/VB that/WDT I/PRP was/VBD not/RB really/RB expecting/VBG the/DT food/NN to/TO be/VB first/JJ class/NN after/IN reading/NN the/DT reviews/NNS ./. But/CC I/PRP think/VB that/WDT Crazy/NNP Ang/NNP Moh/NNP does/VBZ have/VBN some/JJ saving/NN grace/NN ,/, one/CD being/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ joint/NN that/WDT serves/VBZ up/IN an/DT Aussie/NNP Burger/NNP and/CC I/PRP also/RB heard/VBN that/IN he/PRP does/VBZ a/DT Roast/NNP Leg/NN of/IN Lamb/NNP for/IN Weekend/NN lunches/NN for/IN $/$ 15.90/CD ./. -LRB-/. I/PRP think/VB that/WDT is/VBZ worth/JJ checking/VBG out/IN -RRB-/JJ Plus/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VB it/PRP is/VBZ heartening/JJ to/TO see/VB an/DT Aussie/JJ Bloke/NN in/IN the/DT Singapore/NNP heartlands/NNP really/RB trying/VBG to/TO spread/VB some/DT Aussie/JJ culture/NN amongts/. us/PRP more/RB conservative/JJ Singaporeans/NNS ./. </text>
