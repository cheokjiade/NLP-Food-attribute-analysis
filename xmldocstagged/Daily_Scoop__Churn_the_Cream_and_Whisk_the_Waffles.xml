<title>Daily Scoop: Churn the Cream and Whisk the Waffles</title>
<text>I/PRP was/VBD sent/VBN to/TO this/DT stall/NN in/IN sleepy/NNP Sunset/NNP Way/NNP by/IN the/DT Big/NN MOG/NN who/WP would/MD visit/VB the/DT shop/NN to/TO satisfy/VB his/PRP$ ice/NN cream/NN crave/IN every/DT time/NN he/PRP is/VBZ in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. You/PRP may/MD not/RB know/VB who/WP the/DT Big/NN MOG/NN is/VBZ or/RB maybe/RB you/PRP do/VBP ./. He/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB well/RB known/VBN among/IN the/DT people/NN at/IN Church/NN of/IN Our/PRP$ Saviour/NN as/IN well/RB as/IN many/JJ other/JJ churches/NN ./. Anyway/RB I/PRP always/RB enjoy/VB sitting/VBG down/NN with/IN the/DT Big/JJ MOG/NN to/TO listen/VB to/TO his/PRP$ many/JJ stories/NNS ./. You/PRP know/VBP how/RB there/RB are/VBP some/JJ people/NNS who/WP really/RB put/VB you/PRP at/IN ease/NN when/WRB they/PRP speak/VB to/TO you/PRP because/IN their/PRP$ words/NNS are/VBP full/JJ of/IN grace/NN and/CC you/PRP always/RB walk/VB away/RB feeling/VBG very/RB blessed/JJ ?/. The/DT Big/NN MOG/NN is/VBZ one/CD such/NN person/NN ./. I/PRP never/RB walk/VBD away/RB without/IN learning/VBG something/NN about/IN life/NN and/CC how/RB to/TO live/JJ it/PRP better/NN ./. Big/JJ hearted/NN but/CC unfortunately/VBD also/RB big/JJ bellied/NN ,/, I/PRP always/RB have/VBN to/TO straddle/VB the/DT tightrope/NN between/IN blessing/NN him/PRP with/IN his/PRP$ favorite/NN dessert/NN and/CC looking/VBG after/IN his/PRP$ health/NN !/. Anyway/CC I/PRP found/VBD myself/PRP in/IN a/DT quiet/JJ part/NN of/IN Singapore/NN on/IN a/DT lazy/JJ weekday/NN afternoon/NN only/RB to/TO find/VB a/DT small/JJ ice/NN cream/NN cafe/NN that/WDT was/VBD buzzing/RB with/IN activity/NN ./. Oh/EX yeah/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD like/IN an/DT oasis/NN in/IN the/DT desert/NN ./. What/WP makes/VBZ this/DT ice/NN cream/NN parlor/NN different/JJ from/IN the/DT rest/NN is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP churn/VBP their/PRP$ ice/NN cream/NN by/IN hand/NN ./. So/CC it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB interesting/JJ to/TO watch/VB the/DT liquid/JJ cream/NN being/NN poured/NN onto/IN the/DT cold/JJ pan/NN and/CC turning/NN to/TO ice/NN cream/NN as/IN they/PRP churn/VBP it/PRP around/RB ./. According/VBG to/TO the/DT owner/NN their/PRP$ ice/NN cream/NN has/VBZ less/JJ air/NN than/IN those/DT that/WDT are/VBP machine/JJ churned/NN ./. In/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT ice/NN cream/NN more/RB healthy/JJ ,/, the/DT ice/NN cream/NN is/VBZ made/VBD from/IN low/JJ fat/NN milk/NN ,/, no/DT eggs/NN and/CC is/VBZ not/RB overly/RB sweet/JJ ./. I/PRP found/VBD the/DT ice/NN cream/NN here/RB to/TO be/VB more/RB subtle/JJ than/IN the/DT other/JJ ice/NN cream/NN boutiques/NN that/WDT I/PRP have/VB blogged/VBD ./. I/PRP tried/VBD the/DT brandied/NN fig/NN and/CC honey/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD pleasant/JJ but/CC did/VBD not/RB have/VB enough/RB kick/VB from/IN the/DT brandy/NN ./. The/DT butterscotch/NN was/VBD much/JJ better/NN but/CC I/PRP still/RB felt/VBD that/IN the/DT flavors/NNS could/MD be/VB more/JJR robust/NNS ./. However/RB ,/, the/DT real/JJ gem/NN lies/VBZ in/IN the/DT cones/NN and/CC waffles/NN which/WDT were/VBD very/RB very/RB good/JJ ./. On/RB a/DT weekend/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO wait/VB quite/RB a/DT long/JJ time/NN to/TO get/VB your/PRP$ waffles/NN !/. It/PRP was/VBD crisp/JJ on/IN the/DT outside/NN and/CC airy/NN inside/NN with/IN a/DT strong/JJ buttery/JJ vanilla/NN flavor/NN ./. Excellent/JJ with/IN the/DT chocolate/NN ice/NN cream/NN which/WRB was/VBD not/RB overly/RB sweet/JJ and/CC just/RB slightly/RB bitter/JJ ./. The/DT combination/NN of/IN the/DT homemade/JJ cone/NN really/RB lifted/IN the/DT flavor/NN of/IN the/DT butterscotch/JJ ice/NN cream/NN ./. Conclusion/NN Great/JJ waffles/NN and/CC cones/NN ./. The/DT ice/NN cream/NN is/VBZ good/JJ but/CC I/PRP have/VBP yet/RB to/TO find/VB the/DT ice/NN cream/NN flavor/NN that/WDT I/PRP really/RB really/RB like/IN ./. </text>
