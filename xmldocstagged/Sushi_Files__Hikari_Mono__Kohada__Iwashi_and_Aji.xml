<title>Sushi Files: Hikari Mono: Kohada, Iwashi and Aji</title>
<text>If/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT Sushi/NN newbie/NN and/CC have/VB been/VBN aversed/JJ to/TO fishy/JJ fish/NN ,/, then/RB Hikarimono/PRP would/MD probably/RB be/VB the/DT last/JJ type/NN of/IN sushi/NN you/PRP should/VB try/VB ./. Hikarimono/DT literally/JJ means/NN ``/NN Shiny/JJ things/NN ''/NN in/IN Japanese/NN and/CC refers/NN to/TO small/JJ pelagic/JJ fish/NN which/WDT live/JJ in/IN the/DT water/NN column/NN near/IN the/DT surface/NN of/IN the/DT ocean/NN ./. They/PRP often/VB swim/VB in/IN schools/NN and/CC are/VBP forage/JJ feeders/NN and/CC their/PRP$ flesh/NN is/VBZ full/JJ of/IN heart/NN protecting/NN Omega/NN 3/CD fish/NN oils/NN ./. This/DT oil/NN is/VBZ what/WP gives/VBZ its/PRP$ flesh/JJ its/PRP$ soft/JJ and/CC strong/JJ fishy/JJ flavor/NN ./. In/IN contrast/NN ,/, milder/RB tasting/VBG ,/, bottom/RB feeding/JJ fish/NN such/NN as/IN flounder/NN and/CC cod/NN have/VB very/RB little/JJ fat/JJ the/DT flesh/NN as/IN most/NN of/IN the/DT oil/NN is/VBZ concentrated/RB in/IN the/DT liver/NN which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB we/PRP have/VBN Cod/NNP Liver/NNP Oil/NNP ./. These/DT small/JJ fish/NN are/VBZ shiny/JJ and/CC blue/JJ in/IN order/NN to/TO look/VB like/IN the/DT shimmering/JJ water/NN on/IN the/DT surface/NN of/IN the/DT ocean/NN so/RB that/IN they/PRP are/VBP camouflaged/JJ from/IN predators/NNS like/IN Tuna/NNP and/CC Mackeral/NNP ./. They/PRP usually/RB reproduce/VBD quickly/RB and/CC have/VB short/JJ lifespans/NN ,/, so/RB fish/JJ such/NN as/IN sardines/NNS are/VBP herrings/NNS are/VBP a/DT great/JJ choice/NN for/IN those/DT concerned/NN about/IN sustainability/NN and/CC the/DT risk/NN of/IN mercury/NN poisoning/NN as/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB live/JJ long/JJ enough/JJ to/TO accumulate/VB mercury/NN to/TO a/DT toxic/JJ level/NN ./. In/IN general/NN ,/, the/DT Hikarimono/NN tend/NN to/TO have/VB stronger/JJ fish/NN flavor/NN compared/VBD to/TO the/DT Shiromi-dane/JJ or/CC white/JJ flesh/NN fish/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ eaten/VBD precisely/RB because/IN of/IN that/WDT ./. Those/RB people/NNS who/WP are/VBP fond/JJ of/IN fishy/JJ fish/NN would/MD usually/RB love/VB it/PRP but/CC those/RB like/VB myself/PRP who/WP are/VBZ a/DT little/JJ more/NN averse/NN to/TO fishy/JJ fish/NN might/VB take/VB a/DT while/NN to/TO appreciate/VB the/DT taste/NN ./. While/IN you/PRP may/MD eat/VB Shiromi-dane/NN for/IN its/PRP$ texture/NN and/CC subtle/NN sweetness/NN ,/, many/JJ fish/NN fanciers/NN would/MD usually/RB want/VB some/DT Hikarimono/NN towards/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN your/PRP$ sushi/NN meal/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO enjoy/VB the/DT stronger/JJ flavor/NN ./. The/DT exception/NN being/VBG the/DT Kohada/NN which/WDT is/VBZ sometimes/RB eating/VBG at/IN the/DT beginning/VBG of/IN the/DT meal/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO see/VB how/RB good/JJ the/DT chef/NN 's/POS skills/NNS are/VBP ./. There/EX are/VBP several/JJ Hikari/NN Mono/NN that/WDT are/VBP commonly/JJ found/VBN in/IN Singapore/NNP and/CC they/PRP range/VB in/IN prices/NN from/IN the/DT cheapest/JJS which/WDT are/VBP Iwashi/JJ -LRB-/NNP Sardine/NNP -RRB-/NNP and/CC Aji/NNP -LRB-/NNP Horse/NNP Mackeral/NNP -RRB-/NN to/TO the/DT more/JJ expensive/NNP Kohada/NNP -LRB-/NNP Gizzard/NNP Shad/NNP -RRB-/NNP ,/, Sayori/NNP and/CC Saba/NNP -LRB-/NNP Chub/NNP Mackeral/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. Kohada/. This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN those/DT fish/NN that/IN the/DT Japanese/NN call/VBP a/DT Shusse-uo/NN which/WRB means/VBZ that/IN the/DT fish/NN is/VBZ known/VBN by/IN a/DT different/JJ name/NN at/IN different/JJ stages/NN of/IN growth/NN ./. The/DT baby/NN kohada/NN is/VBZ called/VBD a/DT shinko/JJ -LRB-/NN -LRB-/NN 5cm/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC they/PRP are/VBP more/JJ expensive/JJ than/IN the/DT Kohada/NN and/CC come/VB into/IN season/NN in/IN July/NN ./. When/WRB they/PRP reach/VBD 10/CD cm/IN they/PRP are/VBP called/VBD Kohada/NN and/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT usual/JJ size/NN they/PRP serve/VB for/IN sushi/NN ./. Then/RB it/PRP becomes/VBZ a/DT nakatsumi/NN before/IN it/PRP becomes/VBZ known/VBN by/IN its/PRP$ proper/JJ name/NN ,/, Konashiro/NN which/WDT may/MD be/VB around/RB 25cm/RB long/JJ ./. On/RB a/DT side/NN note/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD find/VB that/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT fish/NN are/VBZ called/VBD by/IN the/DT names/NN when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP best/JJ for/IN sushi/NN rather/RB than/IN their/PRP$ proper/NN names/NN as/IN in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN Kohada/NN and/CC Hamachi/NN ./. Kohada/NNS are/VBP plentiful/JJ around/IN the/DT waters/NN of/IN Japan/NNP and/CC at/IN the/DT time/NN when/WRB the/DT Sushi/NN culture/IN first/JJ became/VBD popular/JJ in/IN the/DT Edo/NN period/NN ,/, they/PRP were/VBD plentiful/JJ and/CC cheap/JJ and/CC at/IN one/CD stage/NN even/RB cheaper/RB than/IN rice/NN ./. So/CC they/PRP are/VBP sold/VBN at/IN every/DT street/NN corner/NN and/CC Kohada/NN is/VBZ to/TO sushi/VB what/WP Kleenex/NN is/VBZ to/TO tissue/VB paper/NN ./. Even/RB though/IN the/DT fish/NN is/VBZ called/VBD a/DT gizzard/NN shad/NN ,/, it/PRP really/RB does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB an/DT accurate/JJ English/NN name/NN ./. The/DT American/NN gizzard/NN shad/NN ,/, Dorosoma/NN cepedianum/NN ,/, is/VBZ a/DT fish/JJ belonging/NN to/TO a/DT different/JJ family/NN altogether/NN but/CC you/PRP can/MD understand/VB why/WRB they/PRP call/VBP this/DT a/DT Gizzard/NN Shad/NN as/IN both/DT of/IN these/DT fish/NN have/VBN that/IN distinctive/NN long/JJ ray/NN that/WDT sticks/VB out/VB of/IN the/DT dorsal/JJ fin/NNS like/IN an/DT antennae/NN ./. Kohada/NNP ,/, Gizzard/NNP Shad/NNP :/: Konosirus/NNP punctatus/NNP Size/NNP :/: Up/NNP to/TO 30cm/VB ./. Kohada/PRP is/VBZ best/JJ when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP 15cm/JJ Seasonality/NN :/: Shinko/NNP appear/NNP in/IN July/NN and/CC grows/VBZ into/IN Kohada/NN through/IN winter/. The/DT Tane/NN People/NN often/NN order/VB the/DT Kohada/NN to/TO gauge/VB the/DT skill/NN of/IN the/DT Sushi/NN chef/NN ./. As/CC with/IN most/NN Hikarimono/NN ,/, the/DT fish/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB salted/VBN first/JJ and/CC soaked/VBD in/IN vinegar/NN before/IN being/VBG made/VBD into/IN Sushi/NN ./. The/DT salt/NN serves/VBZ to/TO damage/VB the/DT outer/JJ membrane/NN ,/, allowing/IN the/DT oils/NN of/IN the/DT fish/NN to/TO ooze/VB out/IN when/WRB the/DT vinegar/NN is/VBZ eventually/RB added/VBD ./. This/DT serves/VBZ firstly/VBN to/TO kill/VB any/RB bacteria/JJ as/IN well/RB as/IN to/TO remove/VB the/DT strong/JJ fishy/JJ odour/NN typical/NN in/IN small/JJ oily/JJ fish/NN ./. Sound/DT simple/JJ does/VBZ n't/RB it/PRP ?/. But/CC just/RB how/RB long/JJ to/TO salt/NN the/DT fish/NN depends/VBZ on/IN the/DT weather/NN and/CC that/WDT will/MD eventually/RB determine/VB whether/CC the/DT itamae/JJ manages/NN to/TO bring/VB out/IN the/DT true/JJ taste/NN of/IN the/DT fish/NN ./. The/DT best/JJS sushi/NN bars/NN also/RB tend/VBZ to/TO reuse/VB the/DT vinegar/NN which/WDT will/VB develop/VB more/RB complex/JJ flavors/NNS when/WRB it/PRP has/VB bathed/VB a/DT few/JJ fish/NN ./. Most/JJS Hikarimono/NNS have/VBN to/TO be/VB cured/NN because/IN of/IN their/PRP$ high/JJ oil/NN content/NN ./. In/IN the/DT good/JJ old/JJ days/NNS before/IN refrigeration/NN ,/, that/CC high/JJ oil/NN content/NN means/NN that/IN the/DT fish/NN will/MD turn/VB rancid/NN and/CC spoil/VB quickly/RB ./. That/DT explains/NN why/WRB we/PRP have/VBN canned/NN sardines/NN which/WDT are/VBP another/JJ Hikarimono/NN we/PRP will/VB feature/NN later/NN in/IN the/DT post/NN ./. Kohada/JJ ,/, which/WDT means/VBZ ``/RB small/JJ skin/NN ''/NN in/IN Japanese/NNP has/VBZ an/DT unmistakable/JJ look/VB ./. It/PRP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/NN beautiful/JJ tane/NN to/TO look/VB at/IN ,/, with/IN its/PRP$ small/JJ delicate/NN dots/NN and/CC satin/NN sheen/NN ./. The/DT texture/NN is/VBZ more/RB firm/JJ that/IN the/DT other/JJ Hikarimono/NN and/CC the/DT fishiness/JJ index/NN is/VBZ a/DT 4/CD out/IN of/IN 5/CD ./. This/DT is/VBZ one/CD fish/NN you/PRP have/VB to/TO try/VB if/IN you/PRP want/VB to/TO start/VB learning/VBG about/IN Sushi/NN because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT sushi/NN that/WDT is/VBZ most/RB recognized/JJ in/IN Tokyo/NN as/IN the/DT most/NN popular/JJ sushi/NN sold/VBD in/IN the/DT streets/NN when/WRB Sushi/NN first/JJ rised/NN to/TO popularity/VB back/RB in/IN the/DT early/NNP 1800/NNP 's/POS ./. Iwashi/DT Iwashi/NN There/RB are/VBP many/JJ fish/NN that/WDT are/VBP called/VBD Sardines/NN ./. Actually/RB the/DT fish/NN is/VBZ named/VBD after/IN Sardinia/NN ,/, a/DT region/NN in/IN Italy/NN where/WRB they/PRP used/VBD to/TO catch/VB huge/NN numbers/NN of/IN fish/NN ./. These/DT fish/NN form/IN the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN chain/NN and/CC are/VBP eaten/VBN by/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT larger/JJ fish/NN like/IN swordfish/NN and/CC tuna/NN ./. They/PRP are/VBP very/RB oily/JJ fish/NN and/CC contain/VB lots/NNS of/IN Omega/NN 3/CD fatty/JJ acids/NN ./. But/CC because/IN of/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN fat/NN ,/, they/PRP go/VBP bad/JJ very/RB quickly/RB and/CC so/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT fish/NN are/VBZ preserved/VBD by/IN canning/NN ./. In/IN Japan/NNP ,/, they/PRP are/VBP cheap/JJ fish/NN that/WDT is/VBZ eaten/VBN by/IN the/DT masses/NN but/CC only/RB became/VBD a/DT popular/JJ fish/NN for/IN sushi/NN in/IN the/DT modern/NN era/NN when/WRB refrigeration/PRP could/MD preserve/VB the/DT fish/NN for/IN long/JJ enough/JJ to/TO be/VB eaten/VBN raw/JJ ./. Iwashi/JJ ,/, Sardine/NN ,/, Sardinops/NNP Sagax/NNP Size/NNP :/: 22cm/NNP Season/NNP :/: Autumn/NNP -LRB-/NNP Sep-Oct/NNP -RRB-/. The/DT Tane/NN :/: These/NNP are/VBP beautiful/JJ fish/NN when/WRB presented/VBD as/IN Sushi/NN ./. Unless/IN the/DT Itamae/NN can/NN get/VB hold/NN of/IN absolutely/RB fresh/JJ Iwashi/NN ,/, they/PRP would/MD often/VB be/VB marinated/VBD in/IN salt/NN and/CC vinegar/NN before/IN serving/VBG ./. Usually/JJ ginger/NN and/CC chopped/VBN shallots/NNS are/VBP also/RB added/VBD to/TO help/VB cut/VB through/IN the/DT oil/NN and/CC fishiness/NN ./. This/DT tane/NN is/VBZ easily/RB recognized/VBD by/IN the/DT sliver/JJ skin/NN and/CC the/DT presence/NN of/IN tiny/JJ bones/NNS which/WRB are/VBP perfectly/JJ edible/NN especially/RB if/IN they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN softened/RB after/IN soaking/VBG in/IN vinegar/NN ./. The/DT best/JJS Iwashi/NNS are/VBP eaten/VBN when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP just/RB about/IN to/TO spawn/VB in/IN Autumn/NN which/WDT is/VBZ when/WRB they/PRP get/VB to/TO be/VB their/PRP$ fattest/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP like/VB your/PRP$ fish/NN fishy/JJ ,/, this/DT one/CD is/VBZ bang/JJ for/IN the/DT buck/NN !/. The/DT fishiness/NN index/NN can/MD get/VB to/TO 5/CD out/IN of/IN 5/CD if/IN the/DT fish/NN is/VBZ anything/NN less/JJ than/IN staight/VBG out/IN of/IN the/DT water/NN onto/IN your/PRP$ sushi/NN plate/NN !/. Aji/. It/PRP 's/POS amazing/NN when/WRB you/PRP consider/VB the/DT price/NN difference/NN between/IN the/DT Aji/NN which/WRB comes/VBZ from/IN Japan/NNP and/CC a/DT local/JJ fish/NN which/WDT is/VBZ very/RB similar/JJ ,/, the/DT Kembong/NN ./. The/DT Aji/NN can/NN cost/NN $/$ 80/CD per/NN kg/NN while/IN our/PRP$ Selar/NN is/VBZ so/RB cheap/JJ that/IN a/DT $/$ 2/CD packet/NN of/IN nasi/NN lemak/NN can/MD have/VB one/CD fish/NN ./. It/PRP all/DT boils/NN down/NN to/TO how/WRB the/DT Japanese/NN handle/IN their/PRP$ fish/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP look/VB closely/VB at/IN the/DT photo/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD notice/VB a/DT little/JJ nick/NN just/RB behind/IN the/DT eyes/NN of/IN the/DT fish/NN ./. This/DT give/JJ you/PRP a/DT clue/NN as/IN to/TO how/WRB the/DT fish/NN was/VBD killed/VBN ./. When/WRB I/PRP visit/VB fishing/VB villages/VB in/IN Malaysia/NNP ,/, I/PRP often/MD see/VB piles/NN of/IN fish/NN on/IN decks/NN of/IN fishing/JJ boats/NN which/WDT have/VB been/VBN left/JJ to/TO die/VB of/IN suffocation/NN ./. Then/RB they/PRP are/VBP off/IN loaded/NN onto/IN the/DT market/JJ floor/NN with/IN a/DT bit/NN of/IN ice/NN to/TO be/VB sold/VBD ./. They/PRP are/VBP great/JJ deep/JJ fried/VBD or/CC to/TO be/VB made/VBD into/IN curry/NN ,/, but/CC you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB eat/VB them/PRP for/IN sashimi/NN ./. The/DT Japanese/NN treat/IN their/PRP$ fish/NN very/RB differently/RB ./. They/PRP will/VB try/VB to/TO kill/VB the/DT fish/NN in/IN a/DT way/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP not/RB stressed/JJ ./. Often/RB that/IN means/NN that/IN they/PRP place/NN them/PRP into/IN very/RB cold/JJ salt/NN water/NN and/CC they/PRP are/VBP killed/VBN by/IN a/DT stab/NN into/IN the/DT hind/NN brain/NN and/CC put/VB on/IN ice/NN immediately/NN ./. So/CC it/PRP is/VBZ that/IN care/NN and/CC attention/NN to/TO detail/VB that/PRP enables/VB them/PRP to/TO sell/VB one/CD piece/NN of/IN Aji/NN Sushi/NN for/IN $/$ 8/CD while/NN a/DT whole/JJ Kembong/NN might/VB go/VB for/IN $/$ 1/CD each/JJ ./. The/DT Horse/NN Mackeral/NN is/VBZ not/RB really/RB a/DT Mackeral/NN ./. It/PRP actually/RB belongs/VBD to/TO the/DT same/JJ Jack/NNP family/NN of/IN fish/NN as/IN the/DT Kanpachi/NN and/CC Hamachi/NN ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ probably/RB called/VBD a/DT Horse/JJ Mackeral/NN because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ large/JJ eyes/NN that/WDT make/VB it/PRP look/VB a/DT little/JJ like/IN a/DT horse/NN ./. In/IN Japan/NNP ,/, they/PRP use/VB the/DT prefix/JJ ``/NN Ma/NN ''/NN to/TO refer/VB to/TO the/DT proper/JJ fish/NN for/IN sushi/NN which/WDT in/IN this/DT case/NN would/MD be/VB the/DT Trachurus/JJ Japonicus/NN ./. So/RB you/PRP may/MD have/VB many/JJ species/NN of/IN Aji/NN around/IN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ Ma-aji/JJ that/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN when/WRB eating/VBG sushi/NN ./. The/DT prefix/NN ``/NN Ma/NN ''/NN which/WRB means/VBZ ``/RB true/JJ ''/NN in/IN Japanese/NN is/VBZ used/VBD for/IN many/JJ other/JJ fish/NN species/NN such/NN as/IN Madai/NN ./. The/DT prefix/NN ``/NN Hon/NN ''/NN also/RB has/VBZ a/DT similar/JJ meaning/NN -LRB-/NN real/JJ in/IN Japnanese/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ used/VBD for/IN fish/NN like/IN Hon/NNP Maguro/NNP ./. I/PRP asked/VBD my/PRP$ Japanese/NN friend/NN about/IN this/DT and/CC there/RB is/VBZ n't/RB really/RB an/DT explanation/JJ except/NN that/IN perhapse/NN Ma-Maguro/NN would/MD sound/VB a/DT bit/NN funny/NN ./. Aji/JJ ,/, Horse/JJ Mackarel/NN ,/, Saurel/NN ,/, Trachurus/NNP Japonicus/NNP Seasonality/NNP :/: Spring/NNP and/CC Summer/NNP The/NNP Tane/NNP This/NNP fish/NN may/MD be/VB related/VBD to/TO the/DT Shima/NNP Aji/NNP -LRB-/NNP Striped/NNP Jack/NNP -RRB-/NNP but/CC unlike/VBD the/DT fresh/JJ ,/, sweet/JJ tasting/VBG Shima/NN Aji/NN ,/, the/DT Aji/NN is/VBZ a/DT fishy/JJ fish/NN especially/RB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ anything/NN less/JJ than/IN absolutely/RB fresh/JJ ./. The/DT Japanese/NN word/NN for/IN ``/NN Tasty/NN ''/NN is/VBZ also/RB Aji/JJ as/IN in/IN Aji-no-moto/NN or/CC ``/NN Essence/NN of/IN Taste/NN ''/NN and/CC for/IN those/RB who/WP enjoy/VB strong/JJ tasting/VBG fish/NN ,/, this/DT one/CD will/MD hit/VB all/RB the/DT right/JJ buttons/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ usually/RB taken/VBN with/IN some/JJ ginger/NN and/CC spring/JJ onions/NN ./. Depending/DT on/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT fish/NN ,/, Aji/PRP can/MD score/VB a/DT 5/CD out/IN of/IN 5/CD on/IN the/DT fishiness/NN scale/NN so/RB if/IN your/PRP$ are/VBP aversed/JJ to/TO fishy/JJ fish/NN ,/, you/PRP have/VBP to/TO make/VB sure/VB that/WDT your/PRP$ Aji/NN is/VBZ absolutely/RB fresh/JJ ./.
