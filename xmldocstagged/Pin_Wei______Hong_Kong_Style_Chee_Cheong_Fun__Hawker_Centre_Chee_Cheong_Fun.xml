<title>Pin Wei (品味) Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun: Hawker Centre Chee Cheong Fun</title>
<text>There/EX are/VBP ,/, broadly/NN speaking/NN ,/, two/CD types/NNS of/IN Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN ./. The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ the/DT type/NN you/PRP buy/VB at/IN the/DT hawker/NN center/NNS where/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ taken/VBN out/IN of/IN the/DT steamer/NN and/CC to/TO which/WDT sweet/JJ sauce/NN ,/, chilli/NN sauce/NN and/CC sesame/NN seeds/NNS are/VBP added/VBD ./. The/DT other/JJ type/NN is/VBZ filled/VBD with/IN char/NNP siew/NNP ,/, prawns/NNS ,/, you/PRP tiao/VB or/CC beef/NN and/CC doused/NN with/IN a/DT thin/JJ and/CC sweet/JJ soy/NN sauce/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT Hong/NNP Kong/NNP style/NN Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN that/WDT you/PRP order/VB when/WRB you/PRP are/VBP eating/VBG Dim/NNP Sum/NNP ./. There/EX are/VBP ,/, of/IN course/NN a/DT few/JJ variations/NNS in/IN between/IN ,/, like/IN the/DT one/CD at/IN Smith/NNP Street/NNP food/NN center/NN which/WRB Gastronaut/VBZ tells/VBZ me/PRP is/VBZ served/VBD with/IN dried/JJ prawns/NNS and/CC chopped/VBN green/JJ onions/NN ./. According/VBG to/TO him/PRP ,/, this/DT version/NN has/VBZ been/VBN around/RB for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN and/CC can/MD be/VB considered/VBD the/DT traditional/JJ form/NN of/IN Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN which/WDT is/VBZ n't/RB seen/VB so/RB much/JJ anymore/RB nowadays/RB ./. What/WP has/VBZ emerged/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ hawker/NN centres/NN is/VBZ a/DT number/NN of/IN stalls/NN selling/VBG the/DT Hong/NNP Kong/NNP Style/NN Chee/NN Cheong/NN fun/NN that/WDT is/VBZ freshly/RB made/VBD on/IN the/DT spot/NN ./. Back/VBN in/IN 2007/NN ,/, I/PRP wrote/VBD about/IN one/CD in/IN Old/NNP Airport/NNP Road/NNP which/WDT we/PRP have/VBN been/VBN visiting/VBG regularly/NN since/IN I/PRP wrote/VBD about/IN them/PRP ./. Then/RB in/IN 2008/CD ,/, I/PRP found/VBD another/DT shop/NN selling/VBG Zha/NNP Leong/NNP in/IN Changi/NNP Village/NNP Food/NNP Cenre/NNP ./. There/EX was/VBD another/DT which/WDT I/PRP spotted/VBD at/IN the/DT coffeeshop/NN along/IN Upper/NNP Serangoon/NNP Road/NNP which/WDT houses/NNS Punggol/NNP Nasi/NNP Lemak/NNP ./. I/PRP hear/VBD that/WDT there/EX are/VBP a/DT handful/NN of/IN others/JJ around/IN ./. The/DT appearance/NN of/IN these/DT Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN stalls/NNS are/VBP a/DT welcome/NN development/NN because/IN they/PRP allow/VBP you/PRP to/TO just/RB have/VB your/PRP fix/VB of/IN Char/NNP Siew/NNP Cheong/NNP Fun/NNP without/IN having/VBG to/TO go/VB the/DT Dim/NNP Sum/NNP restaurant/NN ./. But/CC more/JJR than/IN that/WDT ,/, it/PRP allows/VBZ you/PRP to/TO have/VB Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN which/WDT is/VBZ freshly/RB steamed/VBD rather/RB than/IN one/CD which/WDT has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN made/VBD and/CC reheated/NN ./. The/DT texture/NN of/IN a/DT freshly/JJ steamed/JJ Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN is/VBZ softer/JJ and/CC more/JJ silky/NN than/IN those/DT which/WDT have/VB been/VBN and/CC then/RB reheated/RB ./. This/DT has/VBZ something/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN a/DT process/NN called/VBD retrogradation/NN which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ reason/NN why/WRB you/PRP only/RB use/VB overnight/JJ rice/NN to/TO make/VB fried/VBD rice/NN ./. When/WRB a/DT starch/NN is/VBZ cooked/VBN ,/, it/PRP absorbs/VBZ water/NN and/CC turns/VBZ into/IN a/DT gel/NN ./. When/WRB this/DT is/VBZ left/JJ to/TO cool/NN ,/, the/DT starch/JJ crystals/NN undergo/NN retrogradation/NN and/CC become/VBN crystallized/NN ./. In/IN the/DT process/NN ,/, excess/NN water/NN is/VBZ pushed/RB out/VB of/IN the/DT cells/NN and/CC so/RB the/DT starch/JJ becomes/NN more/NN firm/JJ ,/, chewy/JJ and/CC drier/JJ ./. That/DT is/VBZ essentially/RB the/DT difference/NN between/IN Hor/NN Fun/NN and/CC Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN as/IN the/DT Hor/NN Fun/NN is/VBZ also/RB basically/JJ steamed/JJ rice/NN paste/NN ./. The/DT difference/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT Hor/NN Fun/NN is/VBZ left/JJ to/TO rest/NN so/IN that/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ more/RB firm/JJ and/CC you/PRP can/MD stir/RB fry/VB it/PRP without/IN it/PRP breaking/RB ./. Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN is/VBZ softer/JJ and/CC is/VBZ not/RB meant/JJ to/TO be/VB fried/VBD like/IN Hor/NNP Fun/NNP ./. There/EX is/VBZ of/IN course/NN some/NN slight/NN variation/NN in/IN the/DT recipe/NN ,/, but/CC by/IN understanding/VBG the/DT cooking/JJ process/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD better/RBR appreciate/VB what/WP to/TO look/VB for/IN in/IN a/DT good/JJ Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN ./. Since/CC it/PRP is/VBZ eaten/VBD freshly/RB steamed/JJ ,/, Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN should/MD be/VB soft/JJ ,/, silky/NN and/CC slippery/NN rather/RB than/IN having/VBG too/RB much/JJ of/IN a/DT chew/NN ./. It/PRP should/MD also/VB be/VB resilient/JJ enough/JJ such/NN that/IN it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB break/VB apart/RB when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ rolled/VBD ./. Another/JJ advantage/NN of/IN eating/VBG it/PRP when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ freshly/RB steamed/JJ is/VBZ that/IN you/PRP also/RB get/VB to/TO appreciate/VB the/DT aroma/NN of/IN the/DT rice/NN which/WDT quickly/RB dissipates/VB once/RB the/DT rice/NN is/VBZ cooked/VBN ./. A/DT nice/JJ sweet/JJ soy/NN sauce/NN will/VB of/IN course/NN complement/VB the/DT chee/JJ cheong/NN fun/NN ./. The/DT fillings/NN of/IN char/NNP siew/NNP ,/, scallops/NNP ,/, prawns/NNS and/CC even/RB abalone/NN is/VBZ secondary/JJ and/CC a/DT matter/NN of/IN preference/NN ,/, really/RB ./. The/DT Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN at/IN Pin/NN Wei/NN is/VBZ very/RB well/RB made/VBD ./. It/PRP is/VBZ very/RB similar/JJ to/TO the/DT ones/NNS you/PRP would/MD find/VB at/IN the/DT Dim/NNP Sum/NNP restaurants/NN ./. Like/IN the/DT ones/NNS in/IN the/DT restaurants/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP slightly/RB thicker/JJ than/IN the/DT ones/NNS at/IN Old/NNP Airport/NNP Road/NNP and/CC holds/VBD its/PRP$ cylindrical/JJ shape/NN very/RB well/RB while/IN still/RB being/VBG very/RB soft/JJ and/CC smooth/JJ ./. We/PRP tried/VBD the/DT Char/NNP Siew/NNP version/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./. They/PRP use/VB Char/NNP Siew/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ made/VBD by/IN another/DT stall/NN in/IN the/DT food/NN center/NN ,/, so/RB it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB fresh/JJ ./. They/PRP do/VB have/VB prawns/NNS and/CC scallop/JJ versions/NN which/WDT we/PRP did/VBD not/RB try/VB ./. Lao/NNP Ban/NNP Niang/NNP insisted/NNP that/WDT I/PRP should/VB try/VB her/PRP Abalone/NNP version/NN ./. They/PRP use/VB a/DT South/JJ African/NN brand/NN called/VBD Abagold/NN which/WDT she/PRP tells/VBZ me/PRP costs/VBZ $/$ 100/CD a/DT can/NN !/. The/DT soup/NN in/IN the/DT can/NN is/VBZ mixed/VBD with/IN the/DT soy/NN sauce/NN to/TO give/VB it/PRP extra/JJ flavor/NN ./. I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT big/JJ fan/NN of/IN abalone/NN ,/, so/IN its/PRP$ not/RB something/NN I/PRP would/MD order/VB ,/, but/CC it/PRP should/MD appeal/VB to/TO abalone/VB lovers/NNS ./. Running/IN the/DT stall/NN is/VBZ a/DT family/NN who/WP has/VBZ been/VBN making/VBG Chwee/NN Kueh/NN for/IN more/JJR than/IN 50/CD years/NNS before/IN deciding/NN to/TO switch/VB to/TO Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN in/IN the/DT last/JJ two/CD ./. They/PRP tell/VB me/PRP that/IN Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN is/VBZ easier/JJ to/TO than/IN Chwee/JJ Kueh/NN as/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB need/VB as/IN much/JJ space/NN to/TO prepare/VB the/DT chye/NNP poh/NNP -LRB-/NNP pickled/NNP turnips/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. They/PRP spent/VB 6/CD months/NNS researching/VBG and/CC perfecting/VB their/PRP$ Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN recipe/NN which/WDT is/VBZ ,/, like/IN Chwee/NN Kueh/NN is/VBZ made/VBD with/IN a/DT rice/NN flour/NN slurry/NN ./. They/PRP even/RB had/VBD to/TO design/VB and/CC custom/VB build/IN the/DT Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fund/NN steamer/NN to/TO their/PRP$ specifications/NNS ./. Their/PRP passion/NN and/CC attention/NN to/TO details/NNS is/VBZ evident/RB in/IN the/DT final/NN product/NN ./. Conclusion/NN Great/JJ way/NN to/TO get/VB your/PRP$ Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN fix/VB without/IN having/VBG to/TO pay/VB big/JJ bucks/NN at/IN the/DT restaurants/NN !/. And/CC ,/, I/PRP would/MD go/VB so/RB far/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN theirs/PRP is/VBZ better/NN some/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP come/VBN across/IN ./.
