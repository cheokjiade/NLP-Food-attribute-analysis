<title>Ya Kwang Kway Chap: Heavenly Kong Bak, $10 Crab Bee Hoon, Yuppie Kway Chap and Peking Rectums!</title>
<text>Just/RB in/IN case/NN you/PRP are/VBP wondering/VBG what/WP this/DT stall/NN actually/RB sells/VBZ ,/, the/DT answer/NN is/VBZ .../: anything/NN that/IN the/DT owner/NN Jason/NNP is/VBZ passionate/JJ about/IN ./. Well/RB ,/, the/DT mainstay/NN of/IN the/DT stall/NN is/VBZ the/DT Kway/NNP Chap/NNP which/WDT was/VBD recommended/VBN by/IN one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ readers/NNS ,/, Iris/NN ./. She/JJ described/NN this/DT as/IN a/DT Yuppie/JJ Kway/NNP Chap/NNP that/WDT would/MD appeal/VB to/TO people/NN who/WP would/MD otherwise/VB not/RB go/VB near/DT piggy/JJ spare/NN parts/NNS ./. The/DT other/JJ thing/NN that/WDT caught/VBN my/PRP$ attention/NN was/VBD that/IN the/DT stallowner/NN happened/VBD to/TO be/VB an/DT ex-flight/JJ steward/NN ./. Now/JJ ,/, an/DT ex-flight/NN steward/NN opening/VBG a/DT Yuppie/JJ Kway/NNP Chap/NNP stall/NN in/IN Geylang/NN ,/, do/VBP n't/RB you/PRP think/VB that/WDT is/VBZ worth/JJ investigating/NN ?/. And/CC amazingly/RB ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ exactly/RB how/RB I/PRP would/MD describe/VB this/DT Kway/NNP Chap/NNP ./. The/DT taste/NN is/VBZ new/JJ age/NN ,/, delicate/NN and/CC clinical/NN ./. The/DT flavor/NN is/VBZ subtle/JJ such/NN that/WDT you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB really/RB make/VB out/IN the/DT spices/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP combine/VBD to/TO give/VB the/DT Kway/NNP Chap/NN that/IN umami/NN kick/VB ./. Even/RB for/IN a/DT person/NN like/IN me/PRP who/WP do/VBP n't/RB usually/RB eat/VB Da/DT Chang/JJ Tou/NN aka/NN rectums/NN ,/, I/PRP actually/RB found/VBD this/DT one/CD to/TO be/VB quite/RB delectable/JJ ./. Are/IN you/PRP all/DT familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT Ma/JJ Ling/NN canned/NN Kong/NNP Bak/NNP ?/. I/PRP grew/VBD up/IN eating/VBG it/PRP and/CC ooohhhh/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ so/RB yummy/JJ !/. It/PRP 's/POS got/VBD a/DT very/RB special/JJ taste/NN that/WDT I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB quite/RB describe/VB but/CC I/PRP instantly/VB recognize/VB when/WRB I/PRP eat/VB it/PRP ./. Unfortunately/RB ,/, even/RB though/IN there/RB have/VB been/VBN many/JJ new/JJ stalls/NNS sprouting/VB up/IN selling/VBG Kong/NNP Bak/NNP Pau/NNP ,/, there/RB really/RB has/VB not/RB been/VB one/CD that/WDT I/PRP could/MD rave/VB about/IN ./. Not/RB anymore/RB !/. I/PRP think/VB I/PRP have/VB found/VBN my/PRP$ regular/NNP Kong/NNP Bak/NNP Pau/NNP haunt/NNP ./. The/DT Kong/NNP Bak/NNP here/RB has/VBZ got/VBN that/IN special/JJ Ma/NNP Ling/NNP Kong/NNP Bak/NNP taste/NN but/CC without/IN all/NN that/IN lard/NN oil/NN in/IN the/DT sauce/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB overly/RB sweet/JJ but/CC instead/RB has/VBZ got/VBN a/DT really/RB ``/JJ Kiam/NNP Pang/NNP ''/NNP -LRB-/NNP Salty/NNP Savoury/NNP -RRB-/NNP taste/NN that/WDT is/VBZ quite/RB irresistable/JJ ./. Jason/NNP told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT his/PRP$ method/NN of/IN cooking/JJ the/DT pork/NN is/VBZ quite/RB different/JJ and/CC though/IN he/PRP did/VBD not/RB reveal/VB what/WP gave/VBD the/DT pork/NN its/PRP$ ``/JJ Ma/NN Ling/NN ''/NN flavor/NN ,/, he/PRP did/VBD say/VB that/IN he/PRP uses/VBZ Japanese/JJ sauces/NNS to/TO marinade/VB the/DT meat/NN before/IN steaming/VBG for/IN several/JJ hours/NNS ./. It/PRP was/VBD so/RB good/JJ ,/, I/PRP tar/VB paued/VB a/DT whole/JJ box/NN home/NN only/RB to/TO find/VB that/IN my/PRP$ kids/NNS finished/IN it/PRP all/RB up/VB when/WRB I/PRP got/VBD home/NN late/NN from/IN work/NN !/. Now/RB if/IN he/PRP had/VBD deep/JJ fried/VBD the/DT skin/NN so/RB that/IN it/PRP was/VBD wrinkly/IN I/PRP would/MD have/VB immediately/RB give/VB it/PRP a/DT 4.75/NN ./. But/CC even/RB as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, it/PRP deserves/VBZ a/DT commendable/NN For/IN those/DT who/WP like/VB to/TO eat/VB Crab/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN for/IN the/DT Bee/NN Hoon/NN and/CC not/RB necessarily/VB the/DT crab/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ place/NN to/TO have/VB your/PRP$ bee/NNP hoon/NNP without/IN having/VBG to/TO fork/VB out/IN at/IN least/RB forty/JJ bucks/NN ./. The/DT Bee/NN Hoon/NN here/RB is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ and/CC has/VB that/IN crustacean/NN flavor/NN infused/NN into/IN the/DT Bee/NN Hoon/NN ./. For/IN ten/CD bucks/NN you/PRP get/VB a/DT small/JJ but/CC solid/JJ crab/NN ./. Not/RB a/DT bad/JJ way/NN to/TO satisfy/VB that/IN crab/NN bee/NN hoon/NN crave/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBN to/TO hand/NN it/PRP to/TO Jason/NNP to/TO come/VB up/RP with/IN this/DT next/JJ dish/NN which/WDT is/VBZ ``/RB Peking/JJ Rectum/NN ''/NN ./. Yes/EX it/PRP is/VBZ Peking/JJ Duck/NN but/CC instead/RB of/IN Duck/NN skin/NN ,/, Jason/NNP has/VBZ substituted/VBN it/PRP with/IN deep/JJ fried/VBD Da/NN Chang/NN Tou/NN ./. The/DT idea/NN was/VBD so/RB novel/JJ ,/, I/PRP had/VBD to/TO try/VB it/PRP at/IN least/RB once/RB ./. I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN the/DT texture/NN of/IN the/DT deep/JJ fried/VBD Da/NN Chang/NN Tou/NN was/VBD really/RB like/IN the/DT skin/NN of/IN the/DT duck/NN ./. But/CC of/IN course/NN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB taste/VB like/IN duck/NN ,/, it/PRP tastes/VBZ like/IN a/DT sweet/JJ crispy/NN morsel/NN of/IN meat/NN ./. It/PRP 's/POS something/NN you/PRP definitely/RB need/VB to/TO try/VB and/CC take/VB a/DT picture/NN of/IN so/RB that/IN you/PRP can/MD tell/VB the/DT world/NN about/IN it/PRP ./. Conclusion/NN Jason/NNP 's/POS the/DT kind/NN of/IN new/JJ age/NN hawker/NN chef/NN that/WDT is/VBZ going/NN to/IN change/NN the/DT way/NN we/PRP eat/VBD hawker/NN food/NN ./. Passionate/JJ ,/, well/RB traveled/NN and/CC innovative/NN ,/, his/PRP$ constant/JJ experimentation/NN has/VBZ already/RB produced/VBD a/DT Kong/NNP Bak/NNP Pau/NNP that/WDT really/RB is/VBZ darn/JJ shiok/NN ./. I/PRP am/VBP really/RB looking/VBG forward/VB to/TO more/JJR new/JJ creations/NNS coming/VB out/RB from/IN his/PRP$ kitchen/NN ./. He/PRP has/VBZ already/RB promised/VBD me/PRP that/WDT he/PRP will/VB look/VB into/IN the/DT possibility/NN of/IN stir/JJ fried/VBD Lobster/NN noodles/NNS .../: .../: akan/NNP datang/NNP or/CC should/MD I/PRP say/VB .../: makan/NN datang/NN .../: I/PRP hope/VBP .../: I/PRP hope/VBP .../: Ya/NNP Kwang/NNP Kway/NNP Chap/NNP 709/NNP Geylang/NNP Road/NNP -LRB-/NNP Lor/NNP 37/NNP -RRB-/NNP 98170006/NNP 11am/NN to/TO 11pm/VB daily/RB </text>
