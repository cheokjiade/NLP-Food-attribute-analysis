<title>Rosraihanna Soto and Satay: At last, a good Satay!</title>
<text>It/PRP 's/POS been/VBN a/DT long/JJ while/NN since/IN I/PRP was/VBD really/RB thrilled/JJ by/IN a/DT Malay/JJ style/NN satay/NN ./. Just/JJ last/JJ month/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD in/IN KL/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO try/VB the/DT famous/JJ Sate/NN Kajang/NN ./. I/PRP came/VBD away/RB feeling/VBG that/WDT it/PRP hardly/RB lived/VBD up/RP to/TO its/PRP$ reputation/JJ even/NN though/IN the/DT stall/NN sold/VBD 40,000/RB sticks/VBN a/DT day/NN ./. Back/VBN in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, the/DT Malay/NN satay/NN has/VBZ become/VBN too/RB much/JJ of/IN a/DT food/NN that/WDT is/VBZ catered/VBD to/TO the/DT mass/JJ market/NN ./. Go/VB to/TO Lau/NNP Pa/NNP Sat/NNP or/CC East/NNP Coast/NNP Lagoon/NNP Village/NNP Food/NNP Centre/NN and/CC you/PRP be/VB spoilt/NN for/IN choice/NN of/IN a/DT large/JJ number/NN or/CC Satay/NN stalls/NN ./. Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT choice/NN is/VBZ between/IN the/DT bad/JJ and/CC the/DT so-so/NN as/IN there/RB is/VBZ hardly/RB any/RB that/WDT can/MD be/VB remembered/NN as/IN very/RB very/RB good/JJ ./. If/IN you/PRP still/RB remember/VB the/DT days/NNS when/WRB the/DT word/NN Esplanade/NN used/VBD to/TO conjur/VB up/IN thoughts/NN of/IN piping/VBG hot/JJ satays/NNS by/IN the/DT sea/NN rather/RB than/IN two/CD big/JJ inedible/NN durians/NN ./. Then/RB ,/, you/PRP would/MD fondly/RB remember/VB the/DT good/JJ old/JJ satay/NN club/NNS where/WRB names/NNS like/IN Fatman/NN Satay/NN reigned/NN supreme/NN ./. Since/CC then/RB our/JJ present/NN Satay/NN Clubs/NNS are/VBP all/RB but/CC a/DT shadow/NN of/IN what/WP the/DT original/JJ one/CD was/VBD like/IN ./. Goldenmile/JJ Food/NN Centre/NN would/MD not/RB be/VB the/DT first/JJ place/NN you/PRP think/VB about/IN when/WRB you/PRP have/VB the/DT the/DT urge/NN for/IN some/DT satay/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT little/JJ stall/NN run/NN by/IN a/DT very/RB pleasant/JJ Mak/NN Cik/NN serves/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS satays/NNS I/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ./. I/PRP think/VB some/NN might/VB find/VB it/PRP a/DT little/JJ on/IN the/DT sweet/JJ side/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP enjoy/VB the/DT fresh/JJ fragrant/JJ aroma/NN of/IN the/DT lemongrass/NN and/CC the/DT tender/JJ ,/, juicy/JJ pieces/NN of/IN chicken/NN thigh/NN meat/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN marinated/VBD just/RB right/JJ such/NN that/WDT is/VBZ is/VBZ full/JJ of/IN flavor/NN but/CC still/RB tender/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ ./. When/WRB you/PRP plunge/VB the/DT stick/NN of/IN Satay/NN into/IN the/DT Kuah/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD know/VB that/WDT you/PRP are/VBP eating/VBG something/NN that/WDT is/VBZ made/VBD with/IN passion/NN ./. The/DT evidence/NN is/VBZ undeniable/RB ./. The/DT pieces/NN of/IN uneven/JJ peanuts/NNS in/IN the/DT gravy/NN shows/NN that/IN the/DT lady/JJ bothered/NN to/TO roast/NN her/PRP peanuts/NNS before/IN pounding/VBG it/PRP by/IN hand/NN rather/RB then/RB buying/VB them/PRP ready/JJ ground/NN or/CC even/RB grinding/VB them/PRP in/IN a/DT food/NN processor/NN ./. -LRB-/DT She/NN might/VBD call/VBP her/PRP husband/VBD a/DT food/NN processor/NN -RRB-/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ kuah/NN around/IN although/RB as/IN with/IN the/DT satay/NN ,/, some/JJ people/NNS might/VB find/VB it/PRP a/DT bit/NN on/IN the/DT sweet/JJ side/NN ./. The/DT other/JJ dish/NN that/IN this/DT Mak/NN Chik/NN serves/VBZ is/VBZ this/DT really/RB rich/JJ and/CC fragrant/JJ Mee/NNP Soto/NNP ./. She/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB make/VB a/DT huge/JJ vat/NN ,/, but/CC she/PRP has/VBZ a/DT decent/JJ sized/VBD aluminium/NN pot/NN going/NN which/WDT is/VBZ chock/RB full/JJ of/IN ingredients/NNS ./. If/IN you/PRP manage/VBP to/TO sneak/VB a/DT peek/JJ a/DT the/DT pot/NN of/IN soup/NN you/PRP would/MD get/VB to/TO see/VB the/DT old/JJ mother/NN hen/NN enjoying/VBG her/PRP hot/JJ spa/NN with/IN beef/NN tripe/NN and/CC lungs/NN ./. The/DT resulting/NN soup/NN stock/NN is/VBZ a/DT rich/JJ blend/NN of/IN spices/NNS and/CC savoury/JJ essence/NN of/IN beef/NN and/CC chicken/NN !/. ./. Forget/JJ Brands/NN Essence/NN of/IN Chicken/NN !/. If/IN you/PRP need/VBP an/DT energy/NN boost/NN ,/, a/DT robust/JJ and/CC spicy/JJ essence/NN of/IN Cow/NN and/CC Chicken/NN is/VBZ the/DT way/NN to/TO go/VB !/. Conclusion/NN I/PRP just/RB love/VBP writing/VBG about/IN these/DT little/JJ stalls/NNS where/WRB the/DT food/NN is/VBZ made/VBD with/IN such/JJ passion/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ this/DT passion/NN that/WDT differentiates/VBZ between/IN the/DT good/JJ and/CC the/DT great/JJ ./. Sedap/WP lah/PRP !/.
