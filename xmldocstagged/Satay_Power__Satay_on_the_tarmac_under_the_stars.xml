<title>Satay Power: Satay on the tarmac under the stars</title>
<text>There/EX is/VBZ something/NN very/RB romantic/JJ about/IN eating/VBG satay/NN under/IN the/DT stars/NN ./. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mean/VB romantic/NNS like/IN the/DT Valentine/NN 's/POS day/NN kind/NN of/IN romantic/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT nostalgic/JJ kind/NN of/IN romantic/NN ./. I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/WDT if/IN I/PRP mentioned/VBD ``/JJ Satay/NN Club/NN ''/NN ,/, the/DT name/NN would/MD conjure/VB up/NN that/IN fuzzy/NN warm/JJ feeling/VBG of/IN yesteryear/NN in/IN those/DT of/IN us/PRP who/WP are/VBP old/JJ enough/JJ to/TO remember/VB the/DT old/JJ Satay/NN Club/NN at/IN the/DT esplanade/NN ./. The/DT whole/JJ experience/NN of/IN eating/NN Satay/NN really/RB is/VBZ n't/RB just/RB about/IN perfectly/RB grilled/VBN and/CC marinated/VBD sticks/NN of/IN meat/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ about/IN watching/VBG the/DT Satay/NN man/NN jostling/NN with/IN the/DT fire/JJ breathing/NN grill/NN ,/, the/DT smoke/NN ,/, the/DT sizzle/NN ,/, the/DT sea/NN breeze/NN and/CC the/DT stars/NN ./. But/CC not/RB only/RB that/IN ,/, there/RB is/VBZ a/DT big/JJ difference/NN in/IN the/DT atmosphere/NN between/IN just/RB a/DT single/JJ satay/NN stall/NN and/CC a/DT whole/JJ army/NN of/IN satay/NN sellers/NNS fighting/VBG their/PRP$ flames/NN and/CC jostling/NN for/IN your/PRP$ patronage/NN ./. Even/RB the/DT touting/NN can/MD be/VB a/DT pleasurable/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT entire/JJ experience/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP psyched/JJ up/NN for/IN it/PRP !/. Rather/RB than/IN being/NN peeved/NN by/IN their/PRP$ persistence/NN ,/, one/CD can/MD easily/RB diffuse/VB the/DT angst/NN by/IN simply/NN asking/NN them/PRP why/WRB theirs/NN is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS on/IN the/DT beach/NN ./. Nowadays/RB ,/, the/DT closest/JJS thing/NN we/PRP can/MD get/VB to/TO the/DT old/JJ Satay/NN Club/NN experience/NN are/VBZ the/DT Satay/NN Street/NNP at/IN Lau/NNP Pa/NNP Sat/NNP and/CC at/IN Lagoon/NNP Village/NNP Food/NNP Centre/NN ./. I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB say/VB that/IN you/PRP will/VB be/VB able/JJ to/TO find/VB the/DT best/JJ Satays/NN there/RB ,/, but/CC they/PRP are/VBP two/CD places/NNS where/WRB you/PRP relive/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN that/WDT satay/NN club/NN experience/NN ./. Soon/JJ ,/, they/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO be/VB opening/VBG Satay/NN by/IN the/DT Bay/NN over/IN at/IN the/DT Gardens/NN by/IN the/DT Bay/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP looking/VBG forward/VB to/TO see/VB if/IN they/PRP manage/VBD to/TO capture/VB the/DT Satay/NN Club/NN magic/NN there/RB ./. Anyway/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP are/VBP at/IN Lau/NNP Pa/NNP Sat/NN for/IN Satay/NN ,/, the/DT question/NN would/MD inevitably/VB be/VB ``/JJ Which/NN stall/NN should/MD you/PRP patronize/VBP ?/. ''/CC I/PRP visited/VBD Lau/RB Pa/JJ Sat/NN because/IN I/PRP had/VBD wanted/VBD to/TO visit/VB the/DT legendary/JJ Fatman/NN Satay/NN ./. I/PRP had/VBD met/VBN the/DT the/DT 2nd/CD generation/NN owner/NN previously/NN and/CC had/VBD told/VBN him/PRP I/PRP would/MD be/VB back/RB ./. But/CC alas/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD not/RB to/TO be/VB ./. By/CC the/DT time/NN I/PRP made/VBD it/PRP back/RB ,/, he/PRP had/VBD left/JJ !/. So/CC I/PRP had/VBD to/TO settle/VB for/IN Plan/NNP B./NNP Plan/NNP B/NNP was/VBD to/TO find/VB a/DT Satay/NN stall/NN that/WDT was/VBD worth/JJ eating/VBG at/IN ./. Now/JJ ,/, you/PRP are/VBP probably/RB wondering/VBG how/WRB I/PRP settled/VBD on/IN Satay/NN Power/NN ?/. Well/RB ,/, let/VB 's/POS just/RB say/VB that/IN it/PRP was/VBD recommended/VBD to/TO me/PRP by/IN someone/NN who/WP was/VBD very/RB familiar/JJ -LRB-/NN really/RB familiar/JJ -RRB-/NN with/IN each/JJ of/IN the/DT stalls/NNS there/RB and/CC this/DT was/VBD the/DT one/CD that/IN she/PRP recommended/NN ./. One/PRP day/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD probably/RB go/VB back/RB and/CC try/VB a/DT few/JJ sticks/NNS from/IN every/DT stall/NN to/TO find/VB out/IN which/WDT is/VBZ indeed/RB the/DT best/JJS there/EX ,/, but/CC for/IN now/RB I/PRP will/MD just/RB go/VB on/IN recommendation/NN from/IN a/DT reliable/JJ source/NN ./. The/DT star/NN of/IN this/DT particular/JJ satay/NN stall/NN is/VBZ the/DT babat/NN or/CC beef/NN tripe/NN satay/NN ./. They/PRP were/VBD nicely/RB marinated/VBD and/CC very/RB tender/JJ ./. I/PRP was/VBD told/VBN by/IN Lisa/NN ,/, the/DT lady/NN boss/NN that/IN they/PRP slow/JJ cook/VB the/DT tripe/JJ first/JJ before/IN skewering/VBG the/DT satay/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN wonderfully/NN tender/NN texture/NN ./. ./. The/DT chicken/NN satay/NN was/VBD good/JJ but/CC not/RB exceptional/VB ./. It/PRP was/VBD sweet/JJ enough/JJ and/CC because/IN they/PRP use/VBP only/RB chicken/NN thigh/NN meat/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD quite/RB juicy/JJ ./. The/DT satay/NN gravy/NN at/IN this/DT stall/NN is/VBZ quite/RB unique/JJ ./. Instead/JJ of/IN finely/JJ ground/NN peanuts/NNS ,/, the/DT peanuts/NNS are/VBP chunky/JJ ,/, -LRB-/JJ half/NN or/CC quarter/NN of/IN a/DT peanut/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC suspended/NN in/IN a/DT gravy/NN with/IN the/DT consistency/NN of/IN mee/NN rebus/NN gravy/NN ./. Like/JJ mee/NN rebus/NN gravy/NN ,/, it/PRP lacks/VBZ that/IN layer/NN of/IN reddish/NN oil/NN on/IN top/JJ ./. It/PRP 's/POS ok/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB say/VB I/PRP am/VBP bowled/JJ over/IN by/IN it/PRP ./. I/PRP would/MD have/VB preferred/VBN it/PRP with/IN lots/NNS of/IN coarsely/JJ ground/NN peanuts/NNS instead/RB of/IN a/DT few/JJ isolated/JJ big/JJ pieces/NN ./. However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ for/IN those/RB who/WP shun/VBZ that/IN layer/NN of/IN oil/NN on/IN top/NN of/IN the/DT gravy/NN !/. Conclusion/NN I/PRP continue/VBD to/TO bemoan/VB the/DT state/NN of/IN Satay/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. It/PRP ca/MD n't/RB be/VB that/WDT difficult/JJ for/IN someone/NN to/TO come/VB up/RP with/IN a/DT super/RB shiok/JJ satay/NN to/TO rule/VB them/PRP all/RB ,/, can/CC it/PRP ?/.
