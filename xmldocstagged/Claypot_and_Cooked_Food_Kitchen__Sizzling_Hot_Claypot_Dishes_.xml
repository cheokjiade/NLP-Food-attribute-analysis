<title>Claypot and Cooked Food Kitchen: Sizzling Hot Claypot Dishes!</title>
<text>There/EX 's/POS something/NN magical/NN about/IN a/DT claypot/NN ./. When/WRB you/PRP eat/VB food/NN that/WDT is/VBZ cooked/VBN in/IN a/DT claypot/NN ,/, somehow/CC it/PRP just/RB seems/VBZ to/TO taste/VB better/NN ./. Is/WBZ it/PRP real/JJ or/CC simply/RB a/DT psychological/JJ effect/NN ?/. A/DT claypot/JJ rice/NN expert/NN once/RB told/VBD me/PRP his/PRP$ theory/NN that/IN the/DT claypot/NN has/VBZ hairline/RB cracks/VBN in/IN it/PRP which/WDT allow/VBZ the/DT smokiness/NN of/IN the/DT charcoal/NN to/TO permeate/VB through/IN to/TO give/VB the/DT rice/NN that/IN wonderful/JJ smoky/NN flavor/NN ./. Others/PRP have/VBP postulated/VBN that/IN the/DT porous/NN nature/NN of/IN the/DT claypot/NN allows/IN it/PRP to/TO trap/VB organic/NN substances/NN which/WRB combines/VBZ with/IN the/DT clay/NN to/TO impart/VB an/DT earthiness/NN to/TO the/DT food/NN which/WDT porcelain/NN or/CC aluminum/NN can/MD not/RB ./. Another/JJ theory/NN is/VBZ that/IN cooking/NN in/IN a/DT claypot/NN may/MD help/VB neutralize/JJ acids/NN ,/, thereby/RB giving/VBG foods/RB a/DT more/JJ rounded/NN flavor/NN and/CC sweetness/NN ./. Whatever/WP the/DT case/NN may/MD be/VB ,/, one/CD undisputed/NN property/NN of/IN the/DT claypot/NN is/VBZ its/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO keep/VB the/DT food/NN warm/JJ because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO store/NN heat/NN ./. I/PRP think/VB that/WDT this/DT is/VBZ the/DT main/JJ reason/NN that/IN this/DT stall/NN in/IN Chinatown/NN is/VBZ serving/VBG all/DT its/PRP$ dishes/NNS in/IN claypots/NN ./. I/PRP say/VB this/DT because/IN the/DT Chef/NN does/VBZ most/RB of/IN his/PRP$ cooking/NN in/IN a/DT super/RB hot/JJ fiery/NN wok/NN and/CC then/RB serves/VBZ it/PRP in/IN pre-heated/NN claypots/NN ./. So/RB none/NN of/IN the/DT initial/jj cooking/NN is/VBZ actually/RB done/VBN in/IN the/DT claypot/NN ./. It/PRP does/VBZ however/RB gives/VBZ the/DT dishes/NNS a/DT satisfying/JJ sizzle/NN ,/, smoke/NN and/CC scent/NN which/WDT gets/VBZ all/RB the/DT other/JJ patrons/NN excited/NN while/IN it/PRP winds/VBZ its/PRP$ way/NN to/TO your/PRP$ table/NN ./. That/DT ,/, in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, is/VBZ clever/JJ marketing/NN !/. Smith/NNP Street/NNP Food/NNP Centre/NN is/VBZ very/RB much/JJ like/IN our/PRP$ deep/JJ oceans/NN which/WDT still/RB harbor/VBD a/DT multitude/NN of/IN gems/NNS just/RB waiting/VBG to/TO be/VB discovered/VBD ./. This/DT is/VBZ certainly/RB one/CD of/IN them/PRP ./. The/DT uncle/NN here/RB must/RB lose/VB about/IN 2/CD litres/NNS of/IN sweat/NN during/IN the/DT lunch/NN time/NN service/NN as/IN he/PRP goes/VBZ about/IN his/PRP$ daily/NN grind/VB of/IN dueling/NN with/IN the/DT fire/JJ breathing/NN wok/NN ./. Cantonese/JJ cuisine/NN is/VBZ all/RB about/IN wok/NN hei/NN -LRB-/NN breath/NN of/IN wok/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC there/RB is/VBZ no/RB other/JJ way/NN of/IN producing/NN that/IN enigmatic/JJ aroma/NN without/IN facing/VBG a/DT fiery/JJ inferno/NN ./. Sure/JJ ,/, this/DT type/NN of/IN cooking/NN takes/NN place/NN every/DT day/NN in/IN the/DT air-conditioned/NN kitchens/NN of/IN good/JJ Cantonese/NN restaurants/NN ,/, but/CC most/RB of/IN it/PRP is/VBZ undertaken/RB by/IN the/DT minions/NN of/IN Chinese/NNP cooks/NNP ./. It/PRP is/VBZ rare/JJ to/TO actually/RB see/VB a/DT wok/NN master/NN sweating/VBZ it/PRP out/VB in/IN a/DT tiny/JJ hawker/NN stall/NN ./. Uncle/NN tells/VBZ me/PRP that/WDT his/PRP$ Sifu/JJ -LRB-/NN master/NN -RRB-/NN was/VBD none/JJ other/JJ than/IN Chef/NN Tham/NNP Mui/NNP Kam/NN of/IN the/DT legendary/JJ Four/NN Heavenly/NN Kings/NN of/IN Cantonese/JJ Cuisine/NN ./. Having/VBG trained/NN under/IN Master/JJ Chef/NN Tham/NN for/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN years/NNS ,/, he/PRP then/RB opened/VBD his/PRP$ own/JJ Cze/NNP Char/NNP Stall/NNP at/IN Silat/NNP street/NN before/IN moving/VBG to/TO Smith/VB St/JJ Food/NN Centre/NN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ago/RB ./. One/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ things/NN about/IN Claypot/JJ dishes/NNS is/VBZ that/IN the/DT gravy/NN often/NN goes/VBZ so/RB well/RB with/IN rice/NN !/. That/DT is/VBZ the/DT case/NN with/IN our/PRP$ first/JJ dish/NN of/IN which/WDT was/VBD a/DT braised/VBN sea/NN cucumber/NN ./. Now/JJ for/IN $/$ 9/LS ,/, you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB the/DT best/JJS kind/NN of/IN sea/NN cucumber/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD rather/RB crunchy/JJ and/CC tasteless/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT dish/NN was/VBD really/RB good/JJ ./. I/PRP especially/RB like/IN Sio/NNP Bak/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ first/JJ roasted/NN till/NN the/DT rind/NN is/VBZ like/IN keropok/NNP -LRB-/NNP fish/NN crackers/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC then/RB braised/VBN till/IN it/PRP has/VBZ soaked/VBN up/IN all/DT the/DT gravy/NN ./. Best/NN to/TO avoid/VB this/DT if/IN you/PRP are/VBP on/IN a/DT low/JJ carb/NN diet/NN !/. I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT pork/NN liver/NN person/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP can/MD only/RB say/VB that/IN my/PRP$ friends/NNS who/WP live/JJ for/IN liver/NN tell/VB me/PRP that/WDT the/DT pork/NN liver/NN here/RB is/VBZ excellent/JJ ./. Chef/NN gives/VBZ the/DT liver/JJ a/DT quick/JJ smoke/NN and/CC sizzle/NN in/IN his/PRP$ hot/JJ wok/NN and/CC throws/NN in/IN lots/NNS of/IN ginger/NN and/CC green/JJ onions/NN ./. The/DT aroma/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD amazing/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT dish/JJ smoking/NN away/RB when/WRB it/PRP arrived/VBD ./. The/DT liver/NN was/VBD tender/JJ ,/, powdery/NN and/CC not/RB too/RB gamey/JJ ./. Like/. I/PRP said/JJ ,/, I/PRP 'm/VBP not/RB a/DT pork/NN liver/NN person/NN ,/, but/CC those/RB who/WP are/VBP tell/VB me/PRP that/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ well/RB worth/JJ the/DT calories/NNS ./. What/WP got/VBD me/PRP really/RB excited/VB were/VBD his/PRP$ sweet/JJ and/CC sour/JJ pork/NN ./. Not/RB many/JJ places/NNS make/VB sweet/JJ and/CC sour/JJ pork/NN using/VBG the/DT hawthorne/NN fruit/NN anymore/RB ./. Most/JJS places/NNS just/RB replace/IN the/DT sourish/JJ fruit/NN with/IN vinegar/NN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT shame/NN as/IN it/PRP lacks/VBZ that/IN unique/NN fruitiness/NN that/IN the/DT hawthorne/NN imparts/NN to/TO the/DT sauce/NN ./. Chef/NN also/RB deep/JJ fries/NNS the/DT pork/NN only/RB on/IN order/NN so/IN that/WDT the/DT pork/NN is/VBZ crisp/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ ./. The/DT only/RB thing/NN that/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB agree/VB with/IN is/VBZ serving/VBG it/PRP sizzling/VBZ hot/JJ in/IN a/DT claypot/NN ./. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB it/PRP adds/VBZ any/DT value/NN to/TO the/DT dish/NN !/. Shark/JJ lovers/NNS can/MD be/VB rest/NN assured/NN that/IN even/NN though/IN this/DT dish/NN is/VBZ called/VBD Sharks/NN fin/NN soup/NN ,/, there/RB really/RB is/VBZ n't/RB enough/JJ sharks/NN fin/NN in/IN it/PRP to/TO cause/VB a/DT global/JJ calamity/NN ./. And/CC you/PRP should/MD n't/RB expect/VB it/PRP since/IN a/DT big/JJ bowl/NN of/IN it/PRP only/RB costs/VBZ $/$ 18/CD that/WDT is/VBZ enough/RB to/TO feed/VB five/CD persons/NNS ./. However/RB ,/, the/DT soup/NN is/VBZ full/JJ of/IN other/JJ good/JJ stuff/NN like/IN fish/NN maw/NN and/CC freshly/JJ peeled/NN crab/NN meat/NN in/IN a/DT very/RB nice/JJ broth/NN ./. Conclusion/NN Cheap/NN and/CC good/JJ Cantonese/NN style/NN Cze/NNP Char/NNP dishes/NNS expertly/RB prepared/VBD by/IN a/DT wok/NN master/NN and/CC served/VBD in/IN sizzling/NN hot/JJ claypots/NN ./. What/WP more/JJR do/VBP you/PRP need/VB to/TO know/VB ?/.
