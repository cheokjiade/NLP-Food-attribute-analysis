<title>Five Spice Prawn Fritter: Why is Wu Xiang Called Wu Xiang?</title>
<text>One/PRP look/VB at/IN the/DT photo/NN and/CC you/PRP would/MD instinctively/VB call/VBP this/DT dish/NN Ngoh/NN Hiang/NN ,/, but/CC have/VB you/PRP ever/RB wondered/VBN why/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ called/VBD Ngoh/NN Hiang/NN -LRB-/NN Five/CD Flavours/NN -RRB-/NN ?/. Well/RB ,/, there/RB is/VBZ a/DT very/RB simple/JJ answer/NN to/TO that/WDT ./. When/WRB our/PRP$ Hokkien/JJ forefathers/NN brought/VBN this/DT dish/NN over/IN from/IN Fujian/NNP Province/NNP ,/, there/RB were/VBD only/RB 5/CD different/JJ types/NN of/IN fritters/NN that/IN the/DT dish/NN was/VBD comprised/RB of/IN ./. These/DT were/VBD Prawn/NNP Fritters/NNP ,/, Pork/NNP Rolls/NNP -LRB-/NNP Ngoh/NNP Hiang/NN -RRB-/NN ,/, Pork/NNP Liver/NNP Rolls/NNP ,/, Egg/NNP Rolls/NNP and/CC the/DT Pork/NNP Sausage/NNP ,/, hence/IN the/DT name/NN ./. But/CC as/IN time/NN went/VBD by/IN ,/, we/PRP added/VBD other/JJ stuff/NN that/WDT could/MD be/VB deep/JJ fried/VBD and/CC served/VBD with/IN the/DT same/JJ dipping/NN sauce/NN like/IN tofu/NN ,/, fishballs/NN ,/, sotong/NN balls/NNS and/CC rolls/NN of/IN many/JJ different/JJ flavors/NNS ./. Hey/UH ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB complaining/JJ except/NN that/WDT with/IN the/DT increased/NN variety/NN of/IN fritters/NN being/NN offered/NN ,/, most/NN shops/NN have/VB decided/VBD to/TO outsource/VB the/DT items/NNS instead/RB of/IN making/VBG it/PRP themselves/NN and/CC of/IN all/DT the/DT hawker/NN dishes/NNS in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, this/DT particular/JJ dish/NN suffers/NN most/NN from/IN hawkers/NNS being/VBG more/JJR like/IN traders/NN rather/RB than/IN cooks/NN ./. Thankfully/JJ ,/, there/RB are/VBP still/RB stalls/NNS like/IN this/DT particular/JJ one/CD who/WP still/RB stubbornly/JJ hangs/NN on/IN to/TO tradition/NN and/CC makes/VBZ all/PDT the/DT five/CD foundational/NN items/NNS themselves/RB ./. They/PRP do/VB outsource/VB the/DT fishballs/NN and/CC tofu/NN but/CC the/DT classic/JJ five/CD items/NNS of/IN Ngoh/NN Hiang/NN are/VBZ all/DT homemade/NN including/IN the/DT prawn/NN fritters/NN which/WDT is/VBZ done/VBN ala/NN minute/NN ./. I/PRP have/VB not/RB seen/VB anyone/PRP else/RB still/RB making/VBG prawn/NN fritters/NN on/IN the/DT spot/NN which/WDT might/VB explain/VB why/WRB this/DT stall/NN is/VBZ so/RB popular/JJ ./. They/PRP are/VBP so/RB popular/JJ that/IN he/PRP only/RB opens/VB for/IN 2/CD hours/NNS everyday/RB ,/, from/IN 11am/NN to/TO 1pm/VB ./. So/RB if/IN you/PRP want/VB to/TO try/VB this/DT Ngoh/JJ Hiang/NN you/PRP really/RB have/VBN to/TO have/VB an/DT early/JJ lunch/NN !/. Now/RB the/DT thing/NN that/IN I/PRP notice/VBD about/IN this/DT stall/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT overall/NN dish/NN is/VBZ more/RB savoury/JJ than/IN sweet/JJ ./. The/DT Ngor/NN Hiang/NN that/IN I/PRP am/VBP familiar/JJ with/IN usually/RB comes/VBZ with/IN a/DT pinkish/JJ sweet/JJ sauce/NN ./. However/RB ,/, this/DT one/CD comes/VBZ with/IN a/DT sauce/NN that/WDT is/VBZ more/RB like/IN the/DT sauce/NN for/IN a/DT Lor/NNP Mee/NNP ./. The/DT Ngor/NN Hiang/NN and/CC the/DT Egg/JJ rolls/NN were/VBD also/RB more/JJ savoury/NN than/IN sweet/JJ ./. Aside/RB from/IN the/DT Prawn/NNP Fritter/NNP which/WDT I/PRP found/VBD quite/RB special/JJ ,/, albeit/NN very/RB oily/JJ ,/, the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT items/NNS were/VBD unusual/JJ but/CC not/RB spectacular/VB in/IN my/PRP$ books/NN ./. However/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBN to/TO qualify/VB that/IN I/PRP do/VBP like/IN my/PRP$ food/NN a/DT little/JJ on/IN the/DT sweet/JJ side/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP would/MD prefer/VB the/DT sweeter/NN version/NN of/IN the/DT Egg/JJ Rolls/NN or/CC Five/CD Spice/NN Rolls/NN ./. 4\/5/DT Conclusion/NN Personally/RB ,/, I/PRP prefer/VB my/PRP$ Ngor/NN Hiang/NN with/IN a/DT little/JJ more/JJ sweet/JJ to/TO balance/VB out/IN the/DT salty/NN ./. This/DT Ngor/NN Hiang/NN does/VBZ come/VBN across/IN as/IN something/NN that/WDT is/VBZ still/RB very/RB traditional/JJ ./. I/PRP am/VBP not/RB sure/VB I/PRP actually/RB like/IN the/DT traditional/JJ version/NN of/IN Ngor/NN Hiang/NN now/RB that/IN I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN accustomed/VBN to/TO the/DT current/JJ version/NN ./. But/CC this/DT is/VBZ really/RB something/NN that/IN you/PRP would/MD want/VB to/TO try/VB to/TO judge/VB for/IN yourself/PRP$ ./. Talking/JJ about/IN Ngoh/NN Hiang/NN ,/, I/PRP should/MD try/VB to/TO blog/VB the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT good/JJ stalls/NNS around/IN ./. What/WP are/VBP your/PRP$ recommendations/NN ?/. Update/NNP 22/NNP July/NNP 2011/. The/DT stall/NN has/VBZ moved/VBN to/TO :/: Blk/SYM 5/CD ,/, Tanjong/NN Pagar/NN Plaza/NN ,/, #/SYM 02-04/05/CD ,/, Teck/NNP Kee/NNP Coffeeshop/.
