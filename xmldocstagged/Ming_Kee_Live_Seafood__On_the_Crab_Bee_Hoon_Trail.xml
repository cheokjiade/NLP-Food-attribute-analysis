<title>Ming Kee Live Seafood: On the Crab Bee Hoon Trail</title>
<text>I/PRP think/VB Crab/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN is/VBZ currently/RB my/JJ favorite/NN crab/NN dish/NN and/CC I/PRP am/VBP on/IN a/DT pilgrimage/NN to/TO find/VB the/DT ultimate/JJ Crab/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. There/EX are/VBP generally/IN 2/CD types/NNS of/IN Crab/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN --/VBZ a/DT soup/NN and/CC a/DT dry/JJ version/NN ./. I/PRP prefer/VB the/DT dry/JJ version/NN ./. As/CC I/PRP have/VB mentioned/VBD in/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ blog/NN ,/, the/DT widely/RB accepted/JJ Gold/NN Standard/NN for/IN dry/JJ Crab/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN is/VBZ the/DT one/CD at/IN Sin/NNP Huat/NNP ./. But/CC because/IN of/IN the/DT exorbitant/NN prices/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP resisted/VBN going/NN there/RB to/TO -LRB-/VB swindled/JJ -RRB-/NN Ultimately/NN ,/, the/DT question/NN is/VBZ :/: ''/NNP ''/NNP Can/. I/PRP find/VB a/DT Crab/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN that/IN I/PRP am/VBP so/RB satisfied/JJ with/IN that/WDT I/PRP can/MD forget/VBP about/IN ever/RB going/NN to/TO Sin/NNP Huat/NNP ?/. Many/JJ readers/NNS have/VBP written/VBN in/IN to/TO recommend/VB this/DT Crab/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN from/IN Ming/NNP Kee/NNP ./. This/DT Cze/NNP Char/NNP turned/VBD restaurant/NN used/VBD to/TO be/VB in/IN Marine/NN Parade/NN ,/, but/CC got/VBD so/RB popular/JJ that/IN they/PRP shifted/VBD to/TO their/PRP$ current/JJ space/NN at/IN Macpherson/NN ./. Now/JJ its/PRP$ air/JJ conditioned/NN but/CC there/RB is/VBZ still/RB no/RB +/JJ +/NN +/NN added/VBD to/TO the/DT bill/NN ./. The/DT Crab/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC unfortunately/CC I/PRP still/RB have/VBP n't/RB found/VBN my/PRP$ Holy/NNP Grail/NP ./. They/PRP use/VB thin/JJ bee/NN hoon/NN here/RB which/WDT absorbs/VBZ the/DT flavor/NN very/RB well/RB ./. It/PRP was/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ but/CC still/RB lacked/VBD that/IN ooomph/NN I/PRP was/VBD looking/VBG for/IN ./. The/DT crabs/NN are/VBP excellent/JJ ./. The/DT pincers/NNS are/VBP large/JJ and/CC the/DT meat/NN is/VBZ full/JJ ,/, so/RB no/RB complaints/VBD there/RB ./. $/$ 38/CD per/NN kg/NN ./. Overall/IN the/DT food/NN quality/NN here/RB is/VBZ excellent/JJ and/CC the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP quite/RB reasonable/JJ ./. The/DT dish/NN that/WDT is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ is/VBZ the/DT steamed/JJ clams/NNS with/IN garlic/NN ./. The/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ your/JJ typical/NN Cantonese/NN steam/NN fish/NN sauce/NN but/CC they/PRP do/VBP it/PRP extremely/RB well/RB ./. Combined/JJ with/IN the/DT tender/NN and/CC sweet/JJ flesh/NN from/IN the/DT clam/NN ,/, this/DT dish/NN is/VBZ quite/RB addictive/JJ ./. $/$ 20/CD for/IN a/DT large/JJ plate/NN ./. Another/DT sigature/JJ dish/NN was/VBD the/DT Guiness/NNP Pork/NNP Ribs/NNP which/WDT was/VBD thickly/RB chopped/VBN Pork/NNP Ribs/NNP with/IN a/DT sweet/JJ ,/, piquant/NN sauce/NN ./. The/DT meat/NN was/VBD tender/JJ ,/, fresh/JJ and/CC flavoursome/JJ ./. The/DT venison/NN with/IN ginger/NN and/CC shallots/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ and/CC is/VBZ one/CD dish/NN I/PRP will/VB order/VB again/RB when/WRB I/PRP am/VBP there/RB ./. They/PRP used/VBD a/DT very/RB good/JJ quality/NN venison/NN that/WDT is/VBZ so/RB tender/JJ that/IN it/PRP melts/VBD in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN ./. ./. Their/PRP other/JJ signature/JJ dish/NN is/VBZ the/DT fried/JJ Mee/NNP Sua/NNP which/WDT I/PRP found/VBD so/RB so/RB only/RB ,/, though/IN other/JJ members/NN of/IN the/DT family/NN quite/RB liked/VBD it/PRP ./. I/PRP think/VB for/IN me/PRP ,/, mee/NN sua/NN is/VBZ a/DT dish/NN where/WRB I/PRP will/MD need/VB to/TO grow/VB a/DT little/JJ older/NN to/TO appreicate/VB ./. No/DT Teochew/NNP Ah/NN Hia/NN can/MD resist/VB Orh/JJ Nee/NN especially/RB when/WRB they/PRP tell/VBP you/PRP that/IN it/PRP comes/VBZ with/IN pumpkin/NN and/CC gingko/NN nuts/NN ./. The/DT Orh/NN Nee/NN here/RB is/VBZ thick/JJ and/CC gooey/JJ ,/, unlike/IN the/DT semi/JJ watery/NN versions/NN that/IN most/NN restaurants/NN serve/VB ./. The/DT only/RB let/VB down/NN was/VBD the/DT use/VB of/IN coconut/NN which/WDT really/RB spoilt/VB the/DT taste/NN ./. They/PRP should/MD have/VB just/RB left/VBN it/PRP out/RB ./. Overall/DT a/DT very/RB satisfying/JJ experience/NN ./. The/DT standard/JJ of/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ great/JJ across/IN the/DT board/NN ./. Too/DT bad/JJ I/PRP have/VB not/RB found/VBD my/PRP$ ultimate/JJ Crab/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP certainly/RB did/VBD find/VB a/DT very/RB good/JJ live/JJ Seafood/NN Restaurant/NN that/IN I/PRP can/MD return/VB to/TO again/RB ./. -LRB-/NNP T3/NNP .5/NNP +/NNP V2/NNP +/NNP S2/NNP +/NNP E1/NNP -RRB-/NNP </text>
