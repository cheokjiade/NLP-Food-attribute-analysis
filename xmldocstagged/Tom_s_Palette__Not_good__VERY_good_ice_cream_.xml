<title>Tom's Palette: Not good, VERY good ice cream!</title>
<text>I/PRP seldom/VB rave/VB about/IN dessets/NN ./. But/CC I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG to/TO rave/VB about/IN the/DT ice/NN cream/NN here/RB because/IN its/PRP$ been/VBN awhile/RB since/IN I/PRP was/VBD bowled/VBN over/IN by/IN an/DT ice/NN cream/NN ./. I/PRP always/RB liked/VBD small/JJ eateries/NNS where/WRB the/DT people/NNS are/VBP really/RB passionate/JJ about/IN their/PRP$ food/NN ./. When/WRB ice/NN cream/NN is/VBZ made/VBD with/IN such/JJ passion/NN the/DT difference/NN is/VBZ an/DT indelible/JJ quality/NN that/IN manifests/NN in/IN tongue/NNP tingling/NNP delight/NNP ./. My/PRP$ favorite/JJ flavor/NN is/VBZ the/DT ./. Now/JJ ,/, I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN going/VBG around/IN looking/VBG for/IN the/DT ultimate/JJ Black/NNP Sesame/NNP Paste/NNP in/IN Singapore/NNP -LRB-/NNP hot/JJ soup/NN version/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC have/VBN so/RB far/JJ been/VBN dissappointed/NN ./. All/PDT of/IN them/PRP lacked/VBD that/IN rich/JJ nutty/NN savoury/NN flavor/NN I/PRP am/VBP looking/VBG for/IN ./. Imagine/IN my/PRP$ delight/NN when/WRB I/PRP found/VBD this/DT taste/NN sensation/NN in/IN an/DT Ice/NN Cream/NN instead/RB !/. The/DT rich/JJ and/CC smooth/JJ flavor/NN of/IN the/DT black/JJ sesame/NN hits/IN the/DT back/RB of/IN the/DT tongue/NN and/CC lingers/NN for/IN quite/RB awhile/JJ after/IN you/PRP swallow/VBP the/DT ice/NN cream/NN ./. -LRB-/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP bought/VBD ice/NN cream/NN for/IN years/NNS !/. -RRB-/LS ./. Eunice/JJ -LRB-/IN the/DT passionate/JJ ice/NN cream/NN chef/NN -RRB-/NN shared/NN with/IN us/PRP that/WDT and/CC they/PRP perfected/VBD the/DT receipe/NN only/RB after/IN many/JJ trials/NNS ./. The/DT other/JJ flavor/NN that/WDT I/PRP really/RB enjoyed/VBN was/VBD the/DT chocolate/NN ./. No/JJ choc/NN chips/NNS ,/, Belgian/NNP Chocolate/NNP or/CC Oreo/NNP cookies/NNP ,/, simply/NNP Chocolate/NNP ./. The/DT Chocolate/NN here/RB is/VBZ different/JJ ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB overly/RB creamy/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT silky/JJ smooth/JJ and/CC luxurious/JJ blend/NN of/IN semi/NN sweet/JJ chocolate/NN without/IN the/DT bitterness/JJ ./. Now/JJ ,/, we/PRP 've/VBP tasted/VBD chocolate/NN from/IN Haagen/NNP Daaz/NNP ,/, Awfully/NNP Chocolate/NNP ,/, Ben/NNP and/CC Jerry/NNP 's/POS ,/, Swensen/NNP 's/POS but/CC I/PRP must/VB say/VB that/IN this/DT one/CD has/VBZ left/VBN the/DT most/NN lasting/JJ impression/NN for/IN me/PRP ./. Even/RB iwatch_ueat/IN our/PRP$ Godiva/JJ Queen/NN ,/, gave/VBD it/PRP her/PRP stamp/NN of/IN approval/NN ./. In/IN case/NN you/PRP are/VBP wondering/VBG how/WRB to/TO make/VB ice/NN cream/NN at/IN home/NN ./. Eunice/PRP was/VBD kind/JJ enough/JJ to/TO give/VB us/PRP a/DT overview/NN of/IN the/DT process/NN ./. First/JJ boil/IN the/DT milk/NN ,/, eggs/NN and/CC sugar/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT custard/NN ./. Put/VBN in/IN the/DT fridge/NN to/TO cool/VB and/CC then/RB add/VB the/DT cream/NN and/CC custard/NN into/IN the/DT Ice/JJ Cream/NN churner/NN -LRB-/NN shown/NN above/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC add/VB your/PRP$ favorite/NN flavors/NNS ./. Sound/DT simple/JJ does/VBZ n't/RB it/PRP ?/. For/IN $/$ 2.80/CD a/DT cup/NN -LRB-/NN completely/RB packed/VBN not/RB a/DT scoop/NN -RRB-/. I/PRP will/MD just/RB sit/VB back/RB and/CC enjoy/VB the/DT fruits/NN of/IN Eunice/NN 's/POS labor/NN ./. Black/JJ Sesame/NN is/VBZ my/PRP$ absolute/NN favorite/NN ./. Liverpool/NNP swears/NNP by/IN the/DT Apple/NN Pie/NN ,/, iwatch_ueat/NN would/MD die/VB for/IN the/DT chocolate/NN ,/, and/CC even/RB smart/RB who/WP needs/VBZ to/TO cut/VB down/NN on/IN sugar/NN could/MD n't/RB resist/VB taking/VBG more/JJR then/RB a/DT few/JJ mouthful/NN ./. Enough/DT said/JJ ./. </text>
