<title>Ito Kacho Yakiniku Restaurant: Wagyu Beef Yakiniku Cuts Part 3</title>
<text>This/DT is/VBZ Part/RB 3/CD of/IN our/PRP$ exploration/NN of/IN Yakiniku/NNP Beef/NNP Anatomy/NNP ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT bit/NN lost/NN ,/, may/MD I/PRP refer/VBP you/PRP to/TO Part/VB 1/CD and/CC Part/IN 2/CD of/IN Wagyu/NNP Anatomy/NNP 101/CD where/WRB we/PRP covered/VBD various/JJ cuts/NNS of/IN beef/NN from/IN the/DT Ribeye/NN to/TO the/DT Sirloin/NN and/CC the/DT Chuck/JJ Rib/NN to/TO the/DT Silverside/NN ./. In/IN Part/DT 3/CD ,/, we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO cover/VB the/DT belly/JJ portion/NN of/IN the/DT Wagyu/NN Cattle/NN ./. Now/JJ ,/, you/PRP might/VB be/VB asking/VB why/WRB we/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG this/DT ?/. Well/RB ,/, the/DT wonderful/JJ thing/NN about/IN Yakiniku/NNP is/VBZ that/RB since/IN the/DT meat/NN is/VBZ served/VBD in/IN small/JJ bite/VB sized/VBD pieces/NN ,/, not/RB only/RB do/VB you/PRP get/VB to/TO savor/VB the/DT different/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT Wagyu/NN cattle/NNS ,/, there/RB is/VBZ also/RB much/JJ less/JJ wastage/NN ./. In/IN the/DT West/NN ,/, a/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT less/JJ popular/JJ cuts/NNS get/VB turned/VBD into/IN minced/NN beef/NN ./. However/RB ,/, in/IN Yakiniku/NNP ,/, the/DT individual/NN muscles/NN of/IN the/DT cow/NN is/VBZ turned/VBD into/IN bite/VB sized/VBD delights/JJ and/CC each/JJ cut/NN has/VBZ its/PRP$ own/JJ nuances/NN in/IN flavor/NN and/CC texture/NN ./. That/DT is/VBZ what/WP makes/VBZ Yakiniku/NNP such/IN an/DT advernture/NN for/IN the/DT beef/NN lover/NN ./. So/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO fully/VB enjoy/VB the/DT Yakikiku/JJ experience/NN ,/, it/PRP pays/VBZ to/TO know/VB a/DT little/JJ bit/NN about/IN what/WP you/PRP are/VBP ordering/VBG ./. If/IN you/PRP have/VBP ever/RB opened/VBD a/DT Yakiniku/NNP menu/NN and/CC just/RB order/VB according/NN to/IN the/DT prices/NN ,/, then/RB this/DT series/NN of/IN blog/NN posts/NNS is/VBZ for/IN you/PRP ./. By/CC the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT article/NN ,/, you/PRP should/MD know/VB a/DT bit/NN more/NN about/IN the/DT taste/NN and/CC textures/NN of/IN different/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT Wagyu/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN you/PRP can/MD make/VB a/DT wiser/JJ choice/NN ./. As/IN you/PRP will/MD soon/RB discover/VB ,/, more/RB expensive/JJ cuts/NNS do/VBP not/RB necessarily/JJ equate/NN to/TO a/DT better/NN experience/NN !/. Before/IN we/PRP start/VB on/IN our/PRP$ anatomical/JJ adventure/NN ,/, here/RB is/VBZ the/DT necessary/JJ background/NN to/TO the/DT Wagyu/NN beef/NN that/WDT we/PRP will/VB be/VB savoring/JJ ./. Ito/NN Kacho/NN imports/IN their/PRP$ beef/NN directly/NN from/IN a/DT farm/NN in/IN Kagoshima/NNP ./. Kagoshima/NNP ,/, located/VBD on/IN the/DT southern/NN tip/NN of/IN Kyushu/NN island/NN produces/NN 18.5/NN %/: of/IN Japan/NNP 's/POS beef/NN ./. Lately/JJ ,/, they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN promoting/NNP Kagoshima/NNP beef/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP and/CC no/RB doubt/VB you/PRP would/MD have/VB heard/VBN people/NNS talking/VBG about/IN Kagoshima/NNP Beef/NN as/IN if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT top/JJ brands/NNS of/IN Wagyu/NN in/IN Japan/NNP ./. This/DT can/MD be/VB very/RB confusing/RB ./. Kagoshima/NNP Beef/NNP simply/NNP refers/NN to/TO the/DT region/NN of/IN Japan/NNP where/WRB the/DT beef/NN comes/VBZ from/IN and/CC just/RB because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ Kagoshima/NNP Beef/NNP does/VBZ not/RB necessarily/RB mean/VB it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB good/JJ Wagyu/NN ./. Kagoshima/NNP Beef/NNP can/MD still/RB be/VB graded/JJ A1/NN to/TO A5/NNP or/CC even/RB B/JJ and/CC C./JJ And/CC even/RB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ graded/NNP A5/NNP ,/, it/PRP simply/RB refers/VBD to/TO the/DT amount/NN of/IN marbling/VBG in/IN the/DT beef/NN and/CC has/VB nothing/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT flavor/NN of/IN the/DT beef/NN ./. Different/JJ farms/NN in/IN Kagoshima/NNP sell/VB their/PRP$ cattle/NNS through/IN a/DT co-op/NN and/CC their/PRP$ meat/NN is/VBZ labeled/JJ as/IN Kagoshima/NNP beef/NN for/IN export/NN ./. Members/DT of/IN the/DT co-op/NN all/RB agree/VB to/TO feed/VB their/PRP$ cattle/NNS with/IN a/DT standard/JJ feed/VB so/RB that/IN they/PRP will/MD produce/VB beef/NN of/IN a/DT certain/JJ quality/NN and/CC character/NN ./. The/DT advantage/NN of/IN this/DT is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO produce/VB enough/RB beef/NN of/IN similar/JJ quality/NN to/TO satisfy/VB the/DT demands/NN of/IN the/DT export/NN market/NN ./. The/DT disadvantage/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP becomes/VBZ commoditised/NN and/CC loses/VB its/PRP$ character/NN ./. So/RB when/WRB the/DT restaurant/NN tells/VBZ you/PRP they/PRP serve/VBP Kagoshima/NNP Wagyu/NNP ,/, what/WP does/VBZ it/PRP mean/VB ?/. Simply/JJ that/IN the/DT beef/NN comes/VBZ from/IN Kagoshima/NNP prefecture/NNP ./. That/DT is/VBZ all/RB ./. It/PRP certainly/RB does/VBD not/RB mean/VB that/IN they/PRP are/VBP serving/VBG you/PRP a/DT premium/NN Wagyu/NN that/WDT is/VBZ superior/RB than/IN other/JJ Japanese/NNP Wagyu/NNP ./. So/RB when/WRB confronted/NN with/IN Kagoshima/NNP Wagyu/NNP ,/, the/DT discerning/NN beefeater/NN would/MD want/VB to/TO know/VB a/DT bit/NN more/NN about/IN the/DT farm/NN that/IN produces/NN this/DT Wagyu/NN ./. Are/IN they/PRP buying/VBP it/PRP from/IN a/DT co-op/NN or/CC direct/NN from/IN the/DT farm/NN ./. Is/WBZ the/DT meat/NN chilled/JJ or/CC frozen/JJ ?/. What/WP types/NN of/IN special/JJ feeds/NN or/CC techniques/RB does/VB that/IN particular/JJ farm/NN employ/NN that/WDT makes/VBZ their/PRP$ Wagyu/NN special/JJ ?/. With/IN that/WDT in/IN mind/NN ,/, let/VB 's/POS get/VB down/VB to/TO the/DT beef/NN shall/NN we/PRP ?/. Ito/NN Kacho/NN imports/IN their/PRP$ beef/NN directly/NN from/IN a/DT company/NN in/IN Kagoshima/NNP called/VBD Ito-ham/NN which/WRB source/VBZ their/PRP$ Wagyu/NN from/IN selected/NNP farms/NNP ./. They/PRP bring/VBD in/IN A4/NN grade/NN Wagyu/NN which/WDT is/VBZ chilled/JJ ,/, not/RB frozen/JJ and/CC focus/JJ on/IN just/RB the/DT belly/NNP -LRB-/NNP bara/NNP -RRB-/NNP part/NN of/IN the/DT cow/NN ./. What/WP this/DT means/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT prices/NN wo/NN n't/RB be/VB as/IN high/JJ as/IN a/DT restaurant/NN that/WDT serves/VBZ A5/NNP tenderloin/NN or/CC ribeye/NN as/IN these/DT prime/JJ cuts/NNS are/VBP the/DT most/NN expensive/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT beef/NN cattle/NNS ./. However/RB ,/, that/CC certainly/RB does/VB not/RB mean/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ any/RB less/JJ tasty/JJ ./. In/IN fact/NN ,/, I/PRP feel/VB that/IN the/DT less/JJ popular/JJ cuts/NNS are/VBP more/RB tasty/JJ and/CC better/NN suited/NN for/IN Yakiniku/NNP then/RB ribeye/NN or/CC sirloin/NN which/WRB are/VBZ better/NN as/IN a/DT steak/NN ./. The/DT Japanese/NN like/IN the/DT bouncy/NN texture/NN of/IN meat/NN which/WRB develop/VBZ flavor/NN as/IN you/PRP chew/VBP on/IN it/PRP ./. That/DT is/VBZ why/RB naizou/JJ -LRB-/NN innards/VBZ -RRB-/NN is/VBZ very/RB popular/JJ in/IN Japan/NNP ./. Beef/NN intestine/NN ,/, when/WRB grilled/VBN ,/, has/VBZ a/DT very/RB chewy/JJ texture/NN that/WDT is/VBZ quite/RB enjoyable/JJ ./. Like/JJ chewing/NN gum/NN ,/, a/DT little/JJ piece/NN of/IN intestine/NN goes/VBZ much/RB further/JJ than/IN a/DT tender/NN piece/NN of/IN meat/NN ./. Gyutan/DT -LRB-/JJ tongue/NN -RRB-/NN is/VBZ very/RB popular/JJ in/IN Japan/NNP ./. The/DT fact/NN that/IN every/DT cow/NN only/RB possesses/VBZ slightly/RB more/JJR than/IN a/DT foot/NN of/IN tongue/NN makes/VBZ this/DT quite/RB a/DT delicacy/NN ./. Sliced/DT thin/JJ and/CC grilled/VBN ,/, the/DT meat/NN has/VBZ the/DT texture/NN akin/NN to/TO that/WDT of/IN canned/NN abalone/NN and/CC a/DT beefy/NN flavor/NN with/IN a/DT slight/JJ iodine\/metallic/NN aftertaste/NN ./. It/PRP 's/POS something/NN that/WDT grows/VBZ on/IN you/PRP ./. With/IN the/DT tongue/NN out/IN of/IN the/DT way/NN ,/, let/VB us/PRP now/RB focus/VBD on/IN the/DT different/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT belly/NN that/IN Ito/NN Kacho/NN offers/VBZ ./. The/DT different/JJ cuts/NNS are/VBP shown/VBN in/IN the/DT diagram/NN above/NN ./. They/PRP essentially/RB come/VB from/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT cow/NN that/IN corresponds/NN to/TO the/DT front/NN of/IN your/PRP$ chest/NN below/IN the/DT nipples/NN to/TO the/DT belly/JJ area/NN just/RB above/IN the/DT pelvis/NN ./. In/IN the/DT West/NN ,/, these/DT correspond/NN to/TO the/DT Short/JJ Plate/NN and/CC Flank/NN cuts/NNS ./. The/DT top/JJ diagram/NN shows/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT cow/NN from/IN the/DT inside/NN of/IN the/DT carcass/NN while/IN the/DT bottom/JJ diagram/NN shows/IN the/DT part/NN for/IN the/DT cow/NN from/IN the/DT outside/NN ./. Do/VBP n't/RB be/VB too/RB surprised/VBD when/WRB I/PRP refer/VBD to/TO the/DT human/JJ body/NN when/WRB describing/VBZ the/DT anatomy/NN of/IN the/DT cow/NN ./. Most/JJS mammals/MD share/VB the/DT same/JJ anatomical/NN blueprint/NN as/IN humans/NN ,/, hence/NN you/PRP will/VB be/VB able/JJ to/TO find/VB the/DT same/JJ muscle/NN on/IN your/PRP$ own/JJ body/NN ./. I/PRP feel/VB that/IN a/DT little/JJ knowledge/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN will/MD enhance/VB your/PRP$ appreciation/NN of/IN Yakiniku/NNP tremendously/NNP ./. We/PRP start/VB with/IN two/CD of/IN the/DT leaner/NN cuts/NNS ./. The/DT Kainomi/NN is/VBZ known/VBN as/IN the/DT Sirloin/JJ flap/NN in/IN the/DT West/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN T/JJ bone/NN steak/NN before/IN and/CC have/VB come/VBN across/IN a/DT steak/NN where/WRB the/DT Sirloin/NN portion/NN has/VBZ a/DT tail/JJ end/NN that/IN extends/NN downwards/NN ./. That/DT bit/NN will/MD continue/VB as/IN downwards/JJ as/IN the/DT Sirloin/NN flap/NN ./. Anatomically/JJ ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT M./NNP obliquus/NNP abdominis/NNP internus/NNP muscle/NN and/CC is/VBZ middle/JJ of/IN three/CD muscles/NNS that/WDT make/VB up/IN the/DT wall/NN of/IN the/DT belly/NN ./. The/DT muscle/NN fibers/NN here/RB are/VBP thicker/JJ and/CC coarser/JJ but/CC it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ sweet/JJ and/CC beefy/NN flavor/NN and/CC is/VBZ quite/RB juicy/JJ ./. It/PRP is/VBZ actually/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ value/NN for/IN money/NN cut/NN in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD definitely/RB order/VB it/PRP as/IN part/NN of/IN my/PRP$ meal/NN ./. Naka/JJ Bara/NN is/VBZ cut/VBD from/IN the/DT Short/NN Plate/NN and/CC is/VBZ the/DT outer/JJ layer/NN of/IN the/DT abdominal/NN wall/NN anatomically/RB known/VBN as/IN the/DT M./JJ obliquus/NN externus/NN abdominus/NN ./. I/PRP found/VBD it/PRP a/DT bit/NN more/RB chewy/JJ and/CC bouncey/JJ than/IN the/DT Kainomi/NN and/CC not/RB as/IN flavourful/JJ ./. So/RB between/IN the/DT two/CD ,/, which/WDT are/VBZ the/DT same/JJ price/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD go/VB for/IN Kainomi/NN ./. Skirt/JJ steaks/NNS are/VBP very/RB popular/JJ in/IN Mexican/JJ cuisine/NN as/IN Fajitas/NN ./. Skirt/JJ steaks/NNS can/MD be/VB a/DT bit/NN confusing/NN as/IN there/RB is/VBZ the/DT Inside/JJ Skirt/NN and/CC the/DT Outside/JJ Skirt/NN ./. Both/NNS are/VBP actually/RB very/RB different/JJ muscles/NN ./. The/DT Outside/NN Skirt/NN is/VBZ the/DT diaphragm/NN which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT dome/JJ shaped/NN muscle/NN that/IN divides/JJ the/DT body/NN into/IN two/CD cavities/NNP viz/NNP the/DT thorax/JJ -LRB-/NN lungs/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC the/DT abdomen/JJ -LRB-/NN bowels/NN -RRB-/NN ./. When/WRB you/PRP breathe/VB in/IN ,/, the/DT diaphragm/NN muscles/NN contract/NN ,/, flattening/IN the/DT dome/NN which/WRB creates/VBZ negative/RB pressure/JJ and/CC so/RB you/PRP inhale/VB ./. The/DT middle/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT dome/NN is/VBZ all/DT ligament/NN so/RB as/IN you/PRP can/MD imagine/VB ,/, when/WRB you/PRP trim/VB off/IN the/DT middle/JJ part/NN ,/, you/PRP are/VBP left/JJ with/IN a/DT ring/NN like/IN muscle/NN which/WRB skirts/VBZ around/IN the/DT inside/NN of/IN the/DT rib/NN cage/NN ,/, hence/IN the/DT name/NN ,/, I/PRP presume/VBD ./. The/DT Inside/NN Skirt/NN is/VBZ the/DT M./JJ transversus/NN abdominis/NN which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT innermost/JJ layer/NN of/IN the/DT abdominal/NN wall/NN ./. On/IN your/PRP$ body/NN ,/, it/PRP corresponds/VBZ to/TO the/DT muscles/NN between/IN your/PRP$ ribcage/NN and/CC your/PRP$ hip/NN where/WRB the/DT ``/NN love/RB handles/JJ ''/NNS are/VBP ./. Both/JJ inside/NN and/CC outside/NN Skirt/NNS are/VBP thin/JJ and/CC long/JJ muscles/NN with/IN muscle/JJ fibers/NN running/NN perpendicularly/NN across/IN its/PRP$ length/NN ./. -LRB-/NNS like/IN a/DT ladder/JJ -RRB-/NN ./. The/DT fibers/NNS are/VBP rough/JJ but/CC still/RB relatively/RB tender/JJ and/CC very/RB flavourful/JJ since/IN they/PRP line/VBD the/DT inside/NN of/IN the/DT abdominal/NN cavity/NN and/CC are/VBP in/IN direct/NNP contact/NNP with/IN the/DT innards/VBZ ./. Some/DT describe/VB this/DT as/IN a/DT beefy/NN flavor/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO think/VB of/IN it/PRP more/NN as/IN offal/JJ flavor/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT kind/NN of/IN flavor/NN that/WDT you/PRP get/VB with/IN the/DT organ/JJ meats/NNS which/WRB are/VBP usually/RB strong/JJ and/CC metallic/JJ ./. Some/DT might/VB describe/VB it/PRP as/IN gamey/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP not/RB used/VBD to/TO strong/JJ beefy/NN flavor/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD be/VB wise/VBD to/TO avoid/VB this/DT ./. The/DT strong/JJ flavor/NN and/CC tough/NN texture/NN lends/RB well/RB to/TO marination/VB and/CC so/RB that/WDT is/VBZ what/WP the/DT chef/NN does/VBZ with/IN the/DT trimmings/NN after/IN he/PRP cuts/NNS out/IN the/DT sections/NN which/WDT are/VBP presentable/JJ for/IN yakiniku/NN ./. The/DT marinated/VBD Harami/NN is/VBZ very/RB flavourful/JJ and/CC excellent/JJ value/NN ./. You/PRP could/MD order/VB a/DT pot/NN of/IN it/PRP and/CC eat/VB with/IN rice/NN and/CC you/PRP would/MD have/VB a/DT good/JJ meal/NN ./. However/RB ,/, the/DT marination/NN does/VBZ negate/IN the/DT value/NN of/IN the/DT Wagyu/NNP somewhat/NNP since/IN the/DT original/JJ flavor/NN and/CC sweetness/NN of/IN the/DT Wagyu/NN beef/NN is/VBZ overpowered/RB by/IN the/DT flavors/NNS of/IN the/DT marinade/NN ./. Although/CC the/DT restaurant/NN labels/NN Tomo/NN Bara/NN as/IN Karubi/JJ plate/NN ,/, from/IN what/WP I/PRP can/MD gather/VB from/IN the/DT diagram/NN ,/, it/PRP should/MD correspond/VB to/TO Brisket/VB Naval/JJ Plate/NN which/WDT consists/NN of/IN the/DT M/JJ Transversus/NN abdominis/NN and/CC rectus/NN abdominis/NN ./. I/PRP found/VBD the/DT Tomo/NN Bara/NN to/TO be/VB rather/RB rich/JJ ,/, very/RB juicy/JJ ,/, delicate/JJ and/CC somewhat/JJ less/JJ flavourful/JJ ./. It/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ for/IN those/RB who/WP like/IN their/PRP$ meat/NN rich/JJ and/CC soft/JJ ./. For/INs me/PRP ,/, at/IN the/DT same/JJ price/NN range/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD opt/VB for/IN Harami/NN as/IN I/PRP like/VB the/DT stronger/JJ flavor/NN ./. But/CC this/DT is/VBZ a/DT cheaper/JJ alternative/NN to/TO the/DT Tokujo/JJ Bara/NN -LRB-/NN see/VB below/IN -RRB-/NN which/WDT is/VBZ much/RB more/JJ expensive/NN and/CC gives/VBZ you/PRP the/DT similar/JJ ``/NN burst/NN in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN ''/NN feeling/VBG when/WRB you/PRP chew/VB on/IN it/PRP ./. Geta/JJ Karubi/NN consists/NN of/IN the/DT muscles/NN between/IN the/DT ribs/NNS which/WDT are/VBP known/VBN as/IN the/DT internal/NN and/CC external/NN intercostal/NN muscles/NN ./. Together/JJ with/IN the/DT diaphragm/NNP -LRB-/NNP Outside/NNP Skirt/NNP -RRB-/IN they/PRP help/VB to/TO expand/VB the/DT ribcage/NN to/TO enable/VB the/DT animal/NN to/TO breathe/VB ./. This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ favorite/NN cuts/NNS ./. There/EX is/VBZ only/RB less/JJ than/IN 1/CD kg/NN of/IN these/DT in/IN each/JJ animal/NN and/CC I/PRP love/VBP the/DT chewiness/NN of/IN the/DT meat/NN ./. The/DT texture/NN is/VBZ almost/RB like/IN raw/JJ squid/NN and/CC the/DT meat/NN is/VBZ very/RB sweet/JJ ./. I/PRP really/RB enjoy/VB chewing/NN on/IN the/DT beef/NN and/CC slowly/NN extracting/NN and/CC savoring/VBD the/DT flavor/NN ./. Definitely/RB a/DT must/VB try/VB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN something/NN interesting/JJ ./. The/DT Flank/NN is/VBZ that/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT body/NN which/WDT we/PRP all/RB know/VB as/IN the/DT ``/JJ Six/NN Pack/NN ''/NN which/WRB you/PRP can/MD see/VB in/IN those/DT guys/VBZ who/WP sweat/VBZ it/PRP out/VB in/IN gyms/NN and/CC drink/NN protein/NN shakes/NN rather/RB than/IN feasting/NN on/IN real/JJ meat/NN at/IN Yakiniku/NNP restaurants/NN ./. Yeah/JJ ,/, I/PRP have/VBN a/DT Six/NN Pack/NN too/RB ,/, but/CC I/PRP like/VB to/TO keep/VB it/PRP hidden/JJ under/IN the/DT cooler/NN bag/NN ./. Technically/JJ ,/, the/DT Flank/JJ the/DT muscle/NN known/VBN as/IN the/DT M./JJ rectus/NN abdominis/NN and/CC is/VBZ easily/RB recognized/JJ as/IN a/DT long/JJ ,/, flat/JJ muscle/NN with/IN the/DT fibers/NNP running/NNP longitudinally/NNP -LRB-/NNP lengthwise/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. This/DT can/MD be/VB quite/RB a/DT tender/JJ piece/NN of/IN meat/NN and/CC in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS has/VBZ become/VBN quite/RB popular/JJ in/IN the/DT West/NN ./. I/PRP found/VBD the/DT meat/NN juicy/NN and/CC tender/NN and/CC the/DT beefy/NN flavor/NN is/VBZ not/RB as/IN strong/JJ as/IN Harami/NN ./. Sasami/DT is/VBZ essentially/RB the/DT continuation/NN of/IN Tomo/NN Bara/NN and/CC both/DT are/VBP quite/RB similar/JJ except/NN that/IN presentation/NN wise/NN ,/, Sasami/PRP can/MD be/VB cut/NN into/IN nice/JJ rectangles/NN which/WDT is/VBZ more/RB attractive/JJ ./. The/DT meat/NN is/VBZ also/RB more/JJ delicate/NN than/IN Tomo/JJ Bara/NN ./. Finally/WP we/PRP get/VBP to/TO the/DT most/JJ sought/NN after/IN piece/NN of/IN cattle/NNS real/JJ estate/NN for/IN Yakiniku/NNP ,/, the/DT premium/NN Karubi/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ a/DT popular/JJ cut/NN for/IN Yakiniku/NNP because/IN the/DT meat/NN is/VBZ chewy/JJ ,/, juicy/JJ ,/, sweet/JJ and/CC flavourful/JJ ./. The/DT meat/NN is/VBZ also/RB very/RB attractive/JJ ./. It/PRP is/VBZ bright/JJ and/CC beautifully/JJ marbled/NN with/IN a/DT fine/JJ reticular/NN -LRB-/NN net/NN like/IN -RRB-/NN pattern/NN of/IN fat/NN ./. This/DT comes/VBZ from/IN is/VBZ the/DT layer/NN of/IN muscle/NN that/WDT covers/VBZ the/DT rib/NN cage/NN of/IN the/DT cattle/NNS and/CC is/VBZ technically/RB known/VBN as/IN M./JJ Serratus/NN ventralis/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ so/RB named/VBD because/IN the/DT way/NN the/DT muscles/JJ attach/NN to/TO the/DT ribs/NNS looks/VBZ like/IN the/DT teeth/NN of/IN a/DT saw/VBN -LRB-/NN serrated/NN -RRB-/NN ./. You/PRP often/VB see/VB this/DT pattern/NN in/IN body/NNP builders/NNP in/IN the/DT rib/NN area/NN just/RB under/IN the/DT armpits/NN ./. Conclusion/NN We/PRP had/VBD a/DT good/JJ Yakiniku/NNP experience/NN overall/NN ./. The/DT Wagyu/NN was/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ and/CC I/PRP like/VB the/DT balance/NN of/IN the/DT marinade/NN here/RB ./. It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB interesting/JJ that/IN the/DT restaurant/NN only/RB brings/NN meat/NN from/IN the/DT belly/NN portion/NN of/IN the/DT cattle/NNS ./.
