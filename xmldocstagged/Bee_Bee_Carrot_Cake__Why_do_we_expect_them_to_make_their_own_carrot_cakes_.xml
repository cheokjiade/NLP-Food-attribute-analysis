<title>Bee Bee Carrot Cake: Why do we expect them to make their own carrot cakes?</title>
<text>I/PRP have/VB always/RB thought/VBD that/IN the/DT best/JJ carrot/NN cake/NNS are/VBP those/RB where/WRB they/PRP actually/RB steam/VBD their/PRP$ own/JJ carrot/NN cake/NN before/IN frying/VBG ./. But/CC I/PRP had/VBD a/DT different/JJ thought/NN the/DT other/JJ day/NN ./. How/WRB come/VB we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP sellers/NNS to/TO make/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ Kway/NNP Teow/NNP ,/, but/CC we/PRP demand/VBD that/WDT from/IN Carrot/JJ Cake/NN sellers/NNS ?/. It/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ that/IN traditionally/RB they/PRP did/VBD steam/VBG it/PRP themselves/RB ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN those/DT things/NNS that/WDT can/MD actually/RB be/VB outsourced/NN ./. So/RB nowadays/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NN actually/RB take/VB short/NN cuts/NNS because/IN it/PRP makes/VBZ sense/NN for/IN their/PRP$ business/NN and/CC so/RB we/PRP ca/MD n't/RB really/RB fault/VB them/PRP ./. </text>
