<title>Salt Water Cafe: Ultimate Lor Mee Challenge!</title>
<text>Can/VBP you/PRP imagine/VB what/WP the/DT ultimate/JJ Lor/NNP Mee/NNP would/MD look/VB like/VB ?/. Every/JJ now/RB and/CC again/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD let/VB my/PRP$ imagination/NN run/NN wild/NN and/CC fantasize/NN about/IN what/WP the/DT ultimate/JJ plate/NN of/IN Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP ,/, Carrot/NNP Cake/NNP and/CC Beef/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP would/MD look/VB like/VB if/IN I/PRP gave/VBD the/DT hawker/NN a/DT $/$ 15/CD budget/NNS ./. Certainly/JJ ,/, when/CC it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO Beef/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP ,/, you/PRP can/MD easily/RB imagine/VB thin/JJ slices/NNS of/IN Wagyu/NN beef/NN and/CC generous/JJ chunks/NN of/IN beef/NN cheek/NN and/CC shin/NN braised/VBN till/IN its/PRP$ all/DT ready/JJ to/TO dissolve/VB on/IN your/PRP$ tongue/NN with/IN the/DT slightest/NN pressure/NN ./. And/CC of/IN course/NN ,/, the/DT soup/NN would/MD have/VB to/TO be/VB specially/RB prepared/VBD with/IN extra/JJ beef/NN bones/NNS to/TO extract/VB the/DT maximum/NN beef/NN oommmph/NN in/IN each/JJ spoonful/NN ./. Ok/JJ ,/, maybe/RB a/DT $/$ 15/CD budget/NN is/VBZ not/RB enough/JJ for/IN such/JJ a/DT bowl/NN of/IN Beef/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP !/. So/RB ,/, what/WP if/IN I/PRP asked/VBD you/PRP to/TO imagine/VB what/WP your/PRP$ ultimate/JJ bowl/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP would/MD look/VB like/VB ?/. That/DT was/VBD the/DT challenge/NN proposed/NN to/TO Chef/NNP William/NNP Soh/NN of/IN Changi/NNP Village/NNP Hotel/NNP when/WRB Mediacorp/PRP was/VBD searching/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ ultimate/JJ bowl/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP for/IN their/PRP$ TV/NN series/NN on/IN Noodles/NN ./. It/PRP did/VBD n't/RB take/VB Chef/NN William/NN too/RB long/JJ to/TO oblige/VB as/IN hawker/NN food/NN literally/NN runs/VBZ in/IN his/PRP$ blood/NN ,/, having/VBG grown/NN up/NN in/IN a/DT family/NN of/IN hawkers/NNS ./. The/DT bowl/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP that/WDT Chef/NN came/VBD up/RP with/IN has/VBZ special/JJ toppings/NNS of/IN deep/JJ fried/VBD Cod/NNP Fish/NNP ,/, live/JJ prawns/NNS ,/, handmade/NNP Prawn/NNP Rolls/NN ,/, Ngor/NN Hiang/NN and/CC of/IN course/NN braised/VBN pork/NN and/CC eggs/NN ./. The/DT prawn/NN rolls/NN were/VBD excellent/JJ and/CC had/VBD a/DT wonderful/JJ crustacean/NN flavor/NN in/IN it/PRP which/WDT was/VBD only/RB made/VBD more/RB heavenly/JJ when/WRB you/PRP dip/VB it/PRP in/IN the/DT Lor/NNP -LRB-/NNP Braising/NNP Sauce/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. But/CC if/IN you/PRP simply/VB look/VB at/IN the/DT toppings/NNS ,/, you/PRP might/VB miss/VB the/DT star/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ dish/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ in/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT Lor/NN ./. There/EX are/VBP a/DT few/JJ things/NNS that/WDT sets/VBZ this/DT Lor/NN apart/RB from/IN the/DT others/JJ ./. Firstly/RB ,/, the/DT Lor/NN is/VBZ a/DT by/IN product/NN of/IN braising/NN duck/NN and/CC pork/NN ./. So/RB unlike/IN the/DT Lor/NN that/IN you/PRP get/VB outside/NN which/WDT is/VBZ made/VBD as/IN a/DT gravy/NN for/IN the/DT noodles/NNS ,/, the/DT Lor/NN here/RB is/VBZ used/VBD to/TO braise/VB their/PRP$ meats/NNS and/CC thus/VB it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT more/JJ natural/JJ umami/NN ./. The/DT use/VB of/IN spices/NNS here/RB is/VBZ also/RB quite/RB distinct/JJ from/IN your/PRP$ usual/JJ bowl/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP ./. Chef/NNP explains/NNP that/WDT traditionally/RB ,/, a/DT spice/NN called/VBD cao/IN guo/NNP -LRB-/NNP 草果/NNP ,/, black/NNP cardamom/NNP -RRB-/NNP is/VBZ often/RB used/VBD ,/, alongside/JJ other/JJ spices/NNS like/IN cinnamon/NN and/CC star/NN anise/NN ./. When/WRB my/PRP$ bowl/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP arrived/VBD ,/, the/DT smell/NN of/IN the/DT spices/NNS just/RB permeated/IN the/DT air/NN ./. I/PRP thought/VBD at/IN first/JJ that/IN it/PRP was/VBD going/VBG to/TO be/VB a/DT bit/NN too/RB strong/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT gravy/NN turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB quite/RB addictive/JJ ./. Because/DT Chef/NN only/RB uses/VBZ egg/NN white/JJ to/TO thicken/VB the/DT sauce/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB as/IN starchy/JJ as/IN the/DT gravy/NN served/VBD at/IN the/DT hawker/NN stalls/NNS ./. And/CC as/IN with/IN classic/JJ Lor/NNP Mee/NNP ,/, black/NNP vinegar/NNP and/CC chopped/VBN garlic/NN is/VBZ served/VBD alongside/NN which/WDT just/RB elevates/NNS the/DT flavor/NN of/IN the/DT gravy/NN ./. Conclusion/NN It/PRP really/RB is/VBZ n't/RB fair/JJ to/TO compare/VB this/DT $/$ 15/CD bowl/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP to/TO the/DT $/$ 3/CD bowl/NN which/WDT you/PRP buy/VB from/IN the/DT hawker/NN stall/NN ./. I/PRP would/MD honestly/VB say/VB that/WDT if/IN I/PRP went/VBD to/TO my/PRP$ favorite/JJ Lor/NNP Mee/NNP stall/NN at/IN Bukit/NNP Purmei/NNP and/CC bought/VBD a/DT $/$ 3/CD bowl/NN with/IN an/DT additional/NN $/$ 3/CD of/IN extra/JJ ingredients/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD probably/RB be/VB just/RB as/RB happy/JJ ./. But/CC if/IN you/PRP compared/VBD this/DT $/$ 15/CD bowl/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP alongside/NNP a/DT $/$ 15/CD bowl/NN of/IN Ramen/NN ,/, then/RB perhaps/VB you/PRP would/MD feel/VB a/DT little/JJ more/NN justified/NN ./. Personally/RB ,/, I/PRP think/VB that/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT gravy/NN that/WDT makes/VBZ this/DT Lor/NNP Mee/NNP different/JJ from/IN the/DT others/JJ ./. Cod/NNP Fish/NNP is/VBZ great/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB say/VB that/WDT I/PRP prefer/VB it/PRP over/IN Shark/NN meat/NN enough/RB to/TO fork/VB out/IN such/JJ a/DT big/JJ difference/NN ./. As/IN far/JJ as/IN I/PRP know/VBP ,/, no/RB one/CD else/RB has/VBZ come/VBN up/RP with/IN a/DT $/$ 15/CD bowl/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP yet/RB ./. So/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT first/JJ ./. Perhaps/RB ,/, it/PRP would/MD serve/VB as/IN a/DT catalyst/NN to/TO usher/VB in/IN the/DT specialty/NN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP stall/NN just/RB like/IN how/WRB Beach/NNP Road/NNP Prawn/NNP Mee/NNP did/VBD with/IN Prawn/NNP Mee/NNP ?/.
