<title>Balmoral Bakery: I found the my Chicken Pie at last!</title>
<text>If/CC I/PRP mention/VB the/DT words/JJ ``/NN Chicken/NN Pie/NN ''/NN to/TO you/PRP ,/, what/WP image/NN would/MD you/PRP have/VBN in/IN your/PRP$ mind/NN ?/. I/PRP think/VB for/IN guys/VBZ in/IN my/PRP$ generation/NN ,/, they/PRP might/VBN just/RB imagine/VB the/DT round/NN domed/NN pies/NNS which/WRB we/PRP used/VBD to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO get/VB in/IN most/NN bakeries/NN thirty/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./. Nowadays/RB ,/, chicken/NN pies/NNS come/VB in/IN all/DT sorts/NN of/IN shapes/NN and/CC sizes/NNS ,/, so/IN Gen/NNP Yers/NNP might/VBD not/RB even/RB know/VB of/IN these/DT iconic/JJ ones/NNS ./. Yes/EX ,/, to/TO me/PRP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ THE/JJ Chicken/NN Pie/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN looking/VBG around/IN for/IN it/PRP for/IN the/DT longest/JJ time/NN ./. So/RB when/WRB I/PRP found/VBD out/IN about/IN Balmoral/NN Bakery/NN ,/, I/PRP just/RB had/VBD to/TO go/VB get/VB my/PRP$ Chicken/NN Pie/NN fix/VB ./. Balmoral/JJ Bakery/NN was/VBD previously/RB located/VBN in/IN Holland/NNP Village/NNP before/IN they/PRP relocated/VBD to/TO Sunset/VB Way/NN ./. They/PRP are/VBP basically/JJ still/RB selling/VBG the/DT same/JJ stuff/NN that/IN they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN selling/VBG for/IN the/DT last/JJ 40/CD years/NNS ./. There/EX was/VBD a/DT time/NN when/WRB pastries/VBD in/IN Singapore/NNP were/VBD an/DT interpretation/NN of/IN what/WP you/PRP can/MD get/VB overseas/NN ,/, unlike/NN nowadays/RB where/RB globalization/JJ means/NN that/WDT we/PRP actually/RB get/VB the/DT real/JJ deal/NN ./. So/RB we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG about/IN cakes/NNS using/VBG butter/NN cream/NN instead/RB of/IN fresh/JJ cream/NN and/CC custard/NN puffs/NN that/WDT are/VBP filled/VBD with/IN custard/NN that/WDT has/VBZ hardly/VBN any/DT cream/NN or/CC eggs/NN in/IN it/PRP ./. For/INs me/PRP ,/, these/DT are/VBP comfort/JJ food/NN which/WDT I/PRP grew/VBD up/RP eating/VBG ./. Of/IN course/NN I/PRP welcome/VBD the/DT fresh/JJ cream/NN cakes/NNS and/CC the/DT luscious/JJ cream/NN puffs/NN filled/VBD with/IN fresh/JJ cream/NN and/CC laced/NN with/IN real/JJ vanilla/NN seeds/NN ,/, but/CC these/DT classic/JJ favorites/NNS are/VBP great/JJ in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ right/NN ./. A/DT bite/VB into/IN the/DT chicken/NN pie/NN and/CC I/PRP felt/VBD as/IN if/IN I/PRP was/VBD transported/JJ back/RB to/TO a/DT time/NN when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD still/RB wearing/JJ blue/JJ shorts/NN and/CC a/DT white/JJ shirt/NN ,/, walking/VBG around/IN Toa/NNP Payoh/NNP Central/NNP with/IN my/PRP$ school/NN bag/NN ./. Those/NNS were/VBD the/DT days/NNS when/WRB school/NN bags/NN were/VBD small/JJ red/JJ and/CC black/JJ checkered/NN luggage/NN bags/NN rather/RB than/IN the/DT ubiquitous/NN haversacks/NN nowadays/RB ./. I/PRP still/RB remember/VB these/DT chicken/NN pies/NNS being/VBG sold/VBN in/IN a/DT small/JJ warmer/NN placed/NN on/IN top/NN of/IN the/DT cold/JJ display/VB shelves/NN for/IN the/DT cakes/NNS ./. The/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT pies/NNS are/VBP pretty/RB much/JJ what/WP I/PRP remember/VBP ,/, except/NN that/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD they/PRP used/VBD to/TO be/VB bigger/JJR ./. -LRB-/DT Perhaps/RB my/JJ hands/NN were/VBD just/RB smaller/JJ then/RB -RRB-/JJ ./. The/DT lady/NN boss/NN there/RB assures/VBD me/PRP that/WDT they/PRP have/VBN been/VBN using/VBG the/DT same/JJ molds/NN for/IN the/DT chicken/NN pies/NNS since/IN 1965/NN and/CC even/RB the/DT baker/NN is/VBZ still/RB the/DT same/JJ one/CD as/IN well/RB ./. The/DT filling/NN is/VBZ just/RB as/IN I/PRP remembered/VBD ,/, mushed/JJ up/NN potatoes/NNS ,/, carrots/NNS and/CC peas/NNS and/CC that/IN tasty/JJ chunky/NN chicken/NN pieces/NN ,/, all/RB packed/VBN into/IN a/DT buttery/JJ puff/NN pastry/NN ./. Yumm/JJ !/. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD -LRB-/NN Okay/IN it/PRP was/VBD probably/RB 4.25/JJ for/IN taste/NN and/CC another/DT .25/NN for/IN nostalgia/NN -RRB-/. The/DT surprising/NN item/NN that/IN day/NN were/VBD actually/RB the/DT samosas/NN ./. These/DT are/VBP probably/RB the/DT tastiest/JJS ones/NNS that/IN I/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN in/IN recent/JJ memory/NN ./. The/DT filling/NN has/VBZ a/DT savoury/JJ taste/NN which/WDT I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB put/VB my/PRP$ finger/NN on/IN which/WDT is/VBZ very/RB addictive/JJ ./. It/PRP has/VBZ a/DT little/JJ curry/NN in/IN it/PRP but/CC not/RB too/RB spicy/JJ ./. The/DT only/RB drawback/NN is/VBZ that/RB if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB get/VB them/PRP fresh/VB out/VB of/IN the/DT fryer/NN ,/, the/DT skin/NN tends/NN to/TO get/VB chewy/JJ ./. Other/RB than/IN that/WDT ,/, these/DT are/VBP a/DT must/RB try/VB item/NN !/. They/PRP have/VB both/DT Chicken/NN and/CC Beef/NNP Curry/NNP Puffs/NNP here/RB ./. I/PRP tried/VBD only/RB the/DT Beef/NNP Curry/NNP Puff/NNP that/WDT day/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB what/WP I/PRP had/VBD hoped/VBD for/IN ./. The/DT beef/NN filling/NN was/VBD a/DT mushy/NN paste/NN which/WRB lacked/VBZ that/IN beefy/NN flavor/NN and/CC texture/NN of/IN minced/NN beef/NN ./. 3.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD The/DT other/JJ signature/JJ item/NN at/IN the/DT bakery/NN is/VBZ the/DT Custard/NNP Puffs/NNP ./. Technically/JJ ,/, custard/NN is/VBZ supposed/JJ to/TO be/VB a/DT cooked/VBN milk/NN and/CC egg/NN mixture/NN ./. But/CC you/PRP also/RB have/VB custard/VBN that/WDT is/VBZ made/VBD from/IN custard/NN powder/NN and/CC in/IN fact/NN nowadays/RB ,/, you/PRP can/MD even/RB find/VB instant/JJ custard/NN mix/NN made/VBD from/IN carrageenan/NN that/WDT does/VBZ n't/RB even/RB require/VB any/DT heat/NN to/TO thicken/VB ./. Just/RB add/VB water/NN and/CC stir/NN to/TO get/VB custard/NN !/. These/DT custard/JJ puffs/NNS are/VBP designed/VBD for/IN our/PRP$ tropical/JJ weather/NN and/CC can/MD be/VB left/JJ on/IN the/DT table/NN without/IN refrigeration/NN for/IN hours/NNS unlike/IN the/DT fresh/JJ custard/NN variety/NN ./. They/PRP are/VBP the/DT ones/NNS that/WDT we/PRP all/RB grew/VBD up/RP with/IN ./. Yes/EX the/DT vanilla/NN is/VBZ artificial/JJ but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB no/RB less/JJ tasty/JJ ,/, combined/NN with/IN the/DT excellent/JJ choux/NN pastry/NN which/WDT is/VBZ tender/JJ and/CC moist/JJ ,/, this/DT old/JJ school/NN custard/NN puffs/NNS are/VBP a/DT real/JJ afternoon/NN tea/NN treat/NN ./. 4.25/DT \//JJ 5/CD Conclusion/NN We/PRP are/VBP spoilt/JJ for/IN choice/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO pastries/VB nowadays/RB and/CC the/DT latest/JJS ,/, greatest/NNP ones/NNS from/IN Japan/NNP and/CC Europe/NNS are/VBP of/IN course/NN of/IN better/NN quality/NN and/CC finer/NN workmanship/NN ./. But/CC there/RB is/VBZ still/RB a/DT place/NN for/IN bakeries/NN like/IN Balmoral/NN ./. They/PRP serve/VB to/TO remind/VB us/PRP that/WDT what/WP we/PRP used/VBD to/TO find/VB tasty/JJ is/VBZ still/RB tasty/JJ even/NN though/IN it/PRP has/VBZ gone/VBN out/IN of/IN fashion/NN ./. Who/WP knows/NN ,/, there/RB may/MD come/VB a/DT time/NN when/CC butter/NN cream/NN cakes/NNS would/MD become/VBN fashionable/RB again/RB !/.
