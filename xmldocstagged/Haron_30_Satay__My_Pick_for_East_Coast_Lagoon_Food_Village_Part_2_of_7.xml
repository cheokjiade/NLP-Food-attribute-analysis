<title>Haron 30 Satay: My Pick for East Coast Lagoon Food Village Part 2 of 7</title>
<text>If/IN you/PRP are/VBP like/IN me/PRP ,/, you/PRP 'd/MD get/VB frustrated/RB when/WRB you/PRP visit/VB a/DT place/NN like/IN East/NNP Coast/NNP Lagoon/NNP Food/NNP Village/NNP ./. They/PRP have/VBN at/IN least/RB 5/CD stalls/NNS selling/VBG satays/NNS and/CC you/PRP just/RB do/VBP n't/RB know/VB which/WDT one/CD is/VBZ good/JJ ./. Well/RB ,/, fortunately/NN for/IN me/PRP I/PRP got/VBD a/DT tip/NN off/IN from/IN another/DT foodie/NN about/IN Haron/NN 30/CD Satay/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO try/VB it/PRP ./. And/CC it/PRP was/VBD really/RB the/DT best/JJS of/IN the/DT lot/NN ./. I/PRP have/VB randomly/RB tried/VBD the/DT satays/NNS there/RB ,/, but/CC now/RB I/PRP am/VBP sticking/VBG with/IN Haron/NN ./. Firstly/RB ,/, they/PRP use/VB chicken/NN pieces/NN instead/RB of/IN mince/VB and/CC the/DT sticks/NNS are/VBP quite/RB generous/JJ ./. The/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT satay/NN is/VBZ quite/RB good/JJ and/CC the/DT homemade/JJ peanut/NN sauce/NN has/VBZ got/VBN a/DT generous/JJ amount/NN of/IN peanuts/NNS in/IN it/PRP ./. If/IN the/DT peanuts/NNS were/VBD ground/NN coarser/NN ,/, it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN perfect/JJ ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ store/NN with/IN Adrian/JJ Pang/NN 's/POS face/NN on/IN it/PRP and/CC I/PRP notice/VBD that/IN they/PRP are/VBP the/DT first/JJ to/TO close/VB for/IN the/DT night/NN ./. I/PRP guess/VB that/WDT says/VBZ something/NN about/IN the/DT store/NN ./. Not/RB the/DT ``/NN die/VB die/VB must/VB try/VB ''/JJ satay/NN like/IN Super/JJ Chicken/NN Satay/NN Power/NN ,/, but/CC certainly/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP at/IN East/NNP Coast/NNP Lagoon/NNP Food/NNP Village/NNP ,/, you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB go/VB wrong/JJ with/IN this/DT stall/NN ./. $/$ 0.40/CD per/NN stick/NN </text>
