<title>Fatty Ox HK Kitchen: Great Chefs can cook anything!</title>
<text>Fans/JJ of/IN Fatty/NN Ox/NN would/MD probably/RB have/VB known/VBN by/IN now/RB that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ back/RB in/IN business/NN after/IN a/DT hiatus/NN of/IN about/IN 18/CD months/NNS ./. Actually/RB ,/, he/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN back/RB in/IN business/NN for/IN almost/RB a/DT year/NN now/RB but/CC I/PRP only/RB managed/VBD to/TO get/VB to/TO eat/VB there/RB after/IN three/CD failed/NN attempts/NN ./. That/DT is/VBZ the/DT good/JJ news/NN ./. Now/JJ ,/, the/DT bad/JJ news/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP have/VBP been/VBN a/DT fan/NN of/IN Fatty/NN Ox/NN 's/POS Char/NNP Siew/NNP and/CC Roast/NNP Duck/NNP ,/, then/RB you/PRP would/MD be/VB very/RB disappointed/JJ to/TO know/VB that/IN he/PRP is/VBZ not/RB serving/VBG those/DT dishes/NNS at/IN his/PRP$ new/JJ stall/NN in/IN Smith/NNP Street/NNP Food/NNP Centre/NN ./. Instead/JJ ,/, his/PRP$ main/JJ dish/NN now/RB is/VBZ the/DT soya/NN sauce/NN chicken/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP miss/VB his/PRP$ roasted/NN delights/NN ,/, then/RB the/DT next/JJ best/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ to/TO visit/VB his/PRP$ disciple/NN 's/POS stall/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ none/JJ other/JJ than/IN Fatty/NN Cheong/NN at/IN ABC/NNP Brickworks/NNP food/NN center/NN ./. But/CC ,/, just/RB as/IN all/DT brides/NN '/" parents/NNS like/IN to/TO say/VB that/IN they/PRP have/VBP lost/VBN a/DT daughter/JJ but/CC gained/RB a/DT son/NN ,/, we/PRP also/RB can/MD say/VB we/PRP lost/VBD the/DT duck/NN but/CC we/PRP gain/VBD the/DT chicken/NN ./. That/DT 's/POS cos/NN if/IN we/PRP do/VBP n't/RB say/VB good/JJ bye/NN to/TO the/DT duck/NN ,/, we/PRP would/MD have/VB never/RB been/VBN able/JJ to/TO taste/VB Fatty/NN Ox/NN 's/POS excellent/NN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP style/NN soy/NN sauce/NN chicken/NN !/. It/PRP just/RB goes/VBZ to/TO show/VB that/IN a/DT great/JJ chef/NN can/NN just/RB about/IN cook/VB anything/NN and/CC it/PRP would/MD be/VB great/JJ !/. His/PRP soy/NN sauce/NN chicken/NN is/VBZ no/RB exception/JJ ./. The/DT skin/NN is/VBZ wonderfully/JJ luscious/NN with/IN a/DT good/JJ penetration/NN of/IN the/DT braising/NN sauce/NN ,/, making/VBG it/PRP a/DT slippery/NN ,/, savoury/NN ,/, sweet/JJ delight/NN ./. The/DT flesh/NN is/VBZ also/RB wonderfully/JJ tender/NN and/CC the/DT thing/NN that/WDT sets/VBZ his/PRP$ soy/NN sauce/NN apart/RB from/IN the/DT other/JJ two/CD formidable/NN stalls/NN -LRB-/NN Ma/NN Li/NN Ya/NN and/CC Hong/NNP Kong/NNP -RRB-/NN in/IN the/DT same/JJ food/NN center/NN is/VBZ the/DT addition/NN of/IN the/DT wonderfully/NN aromatic/RB chopped/VBN ginger/NN and/CC spring/JJ onion/NN garnish/NN atop/IN the/DT chicken/NN ./. He/PRP also/RB uses/VBZ a/DT larger/JJ chicken/NN which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB his/PRP costs/VBZ $/$ 20/CD a/DT bird/NN while/IN the/DT other/JJ two/CD stalls/NNS are/VBP selling/VBG theirs/NN for/IN $/$ 14/CD ./. I/PRP was/VBD very/RB fortunate/JJ the/DT day/NN I/PRP visited/VBD that/IN the/DT braised/VBN beef/NN has/VBZ n't/RB sold/VBN out/IN yet/RB ./. Rumor/DT has/VBZ it/PRP that/WDT is/VBZ usually/RB sells/VBZ out/RB before/IN lunch/NN time/NN !/. Ngou/JJ Lam/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN those/DT dishes/NNS which/WRB I/PRP really/RB love/VB to/TO eat/VB and/CC there/RB are/VBP not/RB many/JJ good/JJ stalls/NNS around/IN ./. So/RB whenever/IN I/PRP hear/VBD news/NN of/IN a/DT good/JJ Ngou/NN Lam/NN ,/, I/PRP usually/RB make/VB a/DT special/JJ effort/NN to/TO try/VB it/PRP ./. The/DT Ngou/NN Lam/NN here/RB is/VBZ robust/JJ and/CC so/RB it/PRP goes/VBZ really/RB well/RB with/IN a/DT plate/NN of/IN his/PRP$ stringy/JJ Hong/NNP Kong/NNP style/NN egg/NN noodles/NNS ./. I/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBD it/PRP more/RB if/IN the/DT meat/NN were/VBD just/RB a/DT little/JJ more/JJ tender/JJ and/CC there/RB was/VBD a/DT little/JJ more/NN sauce/NN ./. My/PRP$ makan/NN kaki/NN ,/, Gastronaut/NN ,/, who/WP is/VBZ a/DT connoisseur/NN of/IN Cantonese/JJ cuisine/NN also/RB remarked/VB that/IN it/PRP would/MD improved/VBD markedly/RB if/IN he/PRP had/VBD used/VBD the/DT more/JJ expensive/JJ orange/JJ peel/NN like/IN the/DT ones/NNS in/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP ./. Despite/DT these/DT misgivings/NN ,/, this/DT Ngou/NN Lam/NN is/VBZ still/RB very/RB good/JJ and/CC should/MD please/VB all/DT but/CC the/DT most/NN discerning/NN of/IN foodies/NNS ./. Fatty/NN Ox/NN has/VBZ set/NN up/IN his/PRP$ stall/NN with/IN a/DT wok/NN and/CC aside/NN from/IN the/DT Soy/JJ Sauce/NN Chicken/NN which/WDT is/VBZ his/PRP$ standard/JJ fare/NN ,/, he/PRP also/RB caters/VB for/IN functions/NNS and/CC has/VBZ a/DT menu/NN of/IN Cantonese/JJ dishes/NNS to/TO choose/VB from/IN ./. When/WRB we/PRP were/VBD there/RB ,/, I/PRP saw/VBN him/PRP preparing/VBD a/DT banquet/NN for/IN the/DT evening/NN and/CC his/PRP$ dishes/NNS all/RB look/VB very/RB impressive/RB ./. His/PRP wontons/RB were/VBD nice/NN and/CC plump/NN and/CC looks/VBZ very/RB impressive/JJ !/. I/PRP also/RB managed/VBD to/TO taste/VB some/NN of/IN his/PRP$ Hae/NN Zhor/NN that/IN day/NN and/CC they/PRP were/VBD excellent/JJ !/. If/IN its/PRP$ available/JJ ,/, it/PRP wo/MD n't/RB be/VB a/DT waste/VB of/IN calories/NNS to/TO order/VB some/NN !/. Conclusion/NN Fatty/NN Ox/NN is/VBZ back/RB and/CC now/RB he/PRP is/VBZ serving/VBG soy/NN sauce/NN chicken/NN and/CC running/VBD a/DT Hong/NNP Kong/NNP kitchen/NN where/WRB he/PRP can/MD cook/VB up/IN a/DT Hong/NNP Kong/NNP feast/NN on/IN request/VB !/.
