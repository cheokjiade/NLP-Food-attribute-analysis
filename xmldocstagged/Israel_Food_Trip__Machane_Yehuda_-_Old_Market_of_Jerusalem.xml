<title>Israel Food Trip: Machane Yehuda - Old Market of Jerusalem</title>
<text>It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT shame/NN that/IN many/JJ Church/NN groups/NN that/IN travel/NN all/IN the/DT way/NN to/TO Israel/VB to/TO visit/VB the/DT Holy/NNP sites/NNP should/MD miss/VB the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO visit/VB the/DT other/JJ attractions/NN that/IN Israel/NN has/VBZ to/TO offer/VB ./. I/PRP find/VB that/IN you/PRP often/VB discover/VB the/DT pulse/NN of/IN a/DT nation/NN when/WRB you/PRP visit/VB their/PRP$ markets/NN and/CC Jerusalem/NN is/VBZ no/RB exception/JJ ./. In/IN our/PRP$ tour/NN of/IN Israel/NN we/PRP visited/VBD a/DT total/NN of/IN five/CD markets/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT one/CD that/WDT was/VBD most/RB interesting/JJ for/IN me/PRP was/VBD the/DT Machane/NN Yehuda/NN in/IN Jerusalem/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP do/VB get/VB a/DT few/JJ hours/NNS of/IN ``/NN free/JJ and/CC easy/JJ ''/NN time/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT one/CD place/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD highly/RB recommend/VB !/. You/PRP can/MD even/RB buy/VB a/DT prepaid/JJ ticket/NN for/IN around/IN $/$ 30/CD gets/VBZ you/PRP a/DT map/NN and/CC a/DT punchcard/NN and/CC you/PRP can/MD work/VB your/PRP$ way/NN around/IN the/DT market/NN to/TO sample/VB the/DT foodstuff/JJ including/NN cheeses/NN ,/, drinks/NNS ,/, nuts/NN and/CC breads/NN !/. Speaking/JJ of/IN breads/NN ,/, I/PRP should/MD alert/VB you/PRP to/TO an/DT old/JJ bread/NNP ``/NNP shack/NNP ''/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ located/VBN along/IN Agripas/NN street/NN just/RB a/DT short/JJ way/NN from/IN the/DT entrance/NN of/IN Machane/NN Yehuda/NN market/NN which/WRB I/PRP think/VB is/VBZ worth/JJ a/DT short/JJ detour/NN before/IN you/PRP tour/VB the/DT market/JJ proper/NN ./. Here/RB you/PRP will/MD find/VB a/DT very/RB unique/JJ Iraqi/NN style/NN Ashtanur/NN bread/NN which/WDT is/VBZ made/VBD in/IN a/DT fashion/NN that/WDT is/VBZ very/RB similar/JJ to/TO tandoori/VB naan/JJ except/NN that/WDT instead/RB of/IN being/VBG soft/JJ and/CC chewy/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ crisp/JJ and/CC light/JJ ./. If/IN you/PRP walk/VB around/IN the/DT vicinity/NN of/IN Machane/NN Yehuda/NN ,/, you/PRP might/VB notice/VB something/NN very/RB peculiar/RB ./. There/EX seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB half/RB eaten/VBD loaves/NN of/IN bread/NN just/RB left/JJ around/IN everywhere/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ not/RB because/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB a/DT $/$ 500/CD fine/JJ for/IN littering/NN like/IN what/WP we/PRP have/VBP here/RB in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, but/CC that/CC bread/PRP is/VBZ a/DT food/NN that/WDT is/VBZ essential/JJ to/TO life/NN and/CC so/RB it/PRP is/VBZ never/RB thrown/JJ away/RB in/IN the/DT garbage/JJ but/CC left/JJ out/IN in/IN the/DT open/JJ so/IN that/WDT it/PRP will/VB feed/VB the/DT birds/NN and/CC other/JJ animals/NN ./. No/RB wonder/VB Jesus/JJ prayed/NN :/: ''/NNP .../: give/VB us/PRP this/DT day/NN our/JJ daily/NN bread/NN !/. ''/RB and/CC later/NN on/IN told/JJ his/PRP$ disciples/NN :/: ``/. I/PRP am/VBP the/DT bread/NN of/IN life/NN ./. Whoever/WP comes/VBZ to/TO me/PRP will/MD never/RB be/VB hungry/NN ,/, and/CC whoever/JJ believes/NN in/IN me/PRP will/MD never/RB be/VB thirsty/NN ./. ''/RB John/JJ 6:35/. It/PRP 's/POS importance/NN in/IN Jewish/NN society/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB underestimated/NN ./. Right/JJ after/IN our/PRP$ bread/JJ excursion/NN ,/, our/PRP guide/RB led/VBD us/PRP to/TO Machane/VB Yehuda/NNP market/NNP proper/NNP ./. As/IN I/PRP alluded/VBD to/TO earlier/NN ,/, this/DT place/NN is/VBZ bustling/JJ with/IN energy/NN !/. If/IN you/PRP come/VB on/IN a/DT Friday/NN just/RB before/IN the/DT Shabbat/JJ -LRB-/NN Sabbath/NN -RRB-/NN which/WRB starts/VBZ at/IN 6pm/NN ,/, it/PRP will/MD be/VB full/JJ of/IN people/NN stocking/NN up/NN for/IN Shabbat/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP intend/VBP to/TO visit/VB Israel/NN ,/, make/VB sure/VB that/WDT you/PRP arrange/VB your/PRP$ itinerary/NN so/RB that/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB anything/NN you/PRP really/RB want/VB to/TO do/VB on/IN a/DT Saturday/JJ cos/NN on/IN Saturday/NN ,/, the/DT whole/JJ of/IN Israel/NN literally/NN stops/VBZ ./. Well/RB ,/, at/IN least/RB in/IN Jerusalem/NN it/PRP does/VBZ ,/, more/RB than/IN Tel/JJ Aviv/NN ./. There/EX are/VBP no/RB public/JJ buses/NN and/CC most/NN attractions/NNS are/VBP closed/VBD including/NN Machane/NN Yehuda/NN market/NN ./. On/JJ Friday/NN evening/NN ,/, most/RB children/JJ -LRB-/NN adults/NN -RRB-/NN would/MD make/VB it/PRP a/DT point/NN to/TO go/VB visit/VB their/PRP$ parents/NN to/IN light/JJ the/DT candles/JJ say/VB their/PRP$ prayers/NN and/CC break/NN bread/NN ./. They/PRP will/VB do/VB this/DT even/RB if/IN they/PRP have/VBP arranged/VBN dinner/NN somewhere/NN else/RB which/WDT seldom/PRP happens/VBZ ./. This/DT tradition/NN really/RB keeps/VBZ the/DT Jews/JJ connected/NN to/TO their/PRP$ cultural/NN roots/NN and/CC is/VBZ something/NN that/IN I/PRP am/VBP very/RB impressed/JJ with/IN ./. Near/IN the/DT Agripas/NNP Street/NNP entrance/NN to/TO Machane/VB Yehuda/PRP is/VBZ a/DT very/RB interesting/JJ shop/NN where/WRB you/PRP can/MD Etrog/VB the/DT medicine/JJ man/NN ./. He/PRP is/VBZ what/WP you/PRP might/VB call/VBP a/DT naturopath/NN and/CC he/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB a/DT character/NN ./. He/PRP started/VBD the/DT tour/NN of/IN his/PRP$ little/JJ shop/NN by/IN telling/VBG us/PRP the/DT very/RB sad/JJ story/NN of/IN his/PRP$ pet/NN goat/NN ./. When/WRB he/PRP was/VBD a/DT toddler/NN ,/, he/PRP was/VBD a/DT pretty/RB scrawny/JJ and/CC so/RB his/PRP mother/RB made/VBD him/PRP drink/NN milk/NN directly/NN from/IN the/DT teat/NN of/IN the/DT family/NN goat/NNS like/IN her/PRP other/JJ kids/NNS -LRB-/IN goat/CD kids/NNS -RRB-/RB ./. So/CC he/PRP literally/RB grew/VBD up/IN drinking/JJ milk/NN from/IN that/DT goat/NN ./. In/IN 1948/NN ,/, when/WRB Israel/PRP became/VBD a/DT nation/NN ,/, the/DT family/NN who/WP were/VBD part/NN of/IN the/DT Jewish/JJ diapora/NN in/IN Yeman/NN decided/VBD to/TO migrate/VB to/TO Israel/VB ./. So/RB they/PRP killed/VBN the/DT goat/NN and/CC ate/VBD it/PRP !/. But/CC they/PRP managed/VBD to/TO keep/VB its/PRP$ horns/NN in/IN memory/NN of/IN her/PRP !/. The/DT medicine/NN man/NN bellowed/NN out/IN a/DT long/JJ sustained/NN laugh/NN ,/, stopped/NN abruptly/NN and/CC then/RB proceeded/VBD to/TO ask/VB my/PRP$ fellow/NN blogger/NN Joelene/NN to/TO close/VB her/PRP eyes/JJ while/NN he/PRP waved/VBZ the/DT goat/NN 's/POS horns/NN over/IN her/PRP head/VBP all/PDT the/DT while/NN chanting/NN something/NN in/IN Hebrew/NN ./. ``/JJ Ah/NN ,/, now/RB you/PRP feel/VB peaceful/VB right/JJ ?/. RIGHT/JJ ?/. WHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHA/JJ !/. ''/RB It/PRP was/VBD entertaining/JJ to/TO say/VB the/DT least/RB as/IN over/IN the/DT next/JJ 15/CD mins/NN or/CC so/RB ,/, the/DT medicine/NN man/NN introduce/. us/PRP to/TO all/DT manner/NN of/IN herbs/NN and/CC sprays/NN that/WDT can/MD cure/VB anything/NN from/IN migranes/NN to/TO menstrual/VB cramps/NN ./. After/IN the/DT performance/NN ,/, lots/RB of/IN laughter/NN and/CC a/DT few/JJ fresh/JJ fruit/NN drinks/NNS ,/, the/DT show/NN ended/NN and/CC we/PRP all/DT left/JJ for/IN our/PRP$ next/JJ destination/NN ,/, our/JJ minds/NNS rejuvenated/RB ,/, our/JJ complexions/NN smoother/NN and/CC our/PRP$ breaths/JJ smelling/NN of/IN citrus/NN from/IN the/DT mist/NN he/PRP sprayed/VBZ into/IN our/PRP$ mouths/NN ./. No/DT one/CD bought/VBD anything/NN ./. As/IN we/PRP continued/VBD our/JJ way/NN through/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP constantly/RB reminded/VB that/IN Jewish/NN cuisine/NN really/RB is/VBZ a/DT mixture/NN of/IN the/DT different/JJ types/NN of/IN cuisines/NN which/WDT the/DT Jewish/NN diaspora/RB brought/VBN back/RB from/IN the/DT countries/NN they/PRP were/VBD living/VBN in/IN ./. So/RB for/IN instance/NN the/DT Kugel/NN is/VBZ a/DT dish/NN of/IN baked/VBD noodles/NNS ,/, eggs/NN and/CC caramel/NN made/VBD by/IN Ashkenazi/NN Jews/NN who/WP adapted/VBZ it/PRP from/IN a/DT German/JJ recipe/NN for/IN the/DT Shabbat/NN ./. Since/IN no/DT cooking/NN can/MD be/VB done/VBN during/IN the/DT Shabbat/NN ,/, they/PRP would/MD bake/NN these/DT before/IN the/DT start/VB of/IN the/DT Shabbat/NN and/CC eat/VB it/PRP together/RB with/IN pickles/NN ./. One/CD of/IN the/DT very/RB popular/JJ stalls/NNS at/IN the/DT market/NN is/VBZ Halva/JJ Kingdom/NN which/WDT as/IN been/VBN selling/VBG the/DT sweet/JJ sesame/NN dessert/NN since/IN 1947/NN ./. They/PRP make/VB all/RB the/DT halva/NN themselves/NN using/VBG quality/NN Egyptian/NN sesame/NN seeds/NN and/CC in/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN flavors/NNS including/IN coffee/NN ,/, chocolate/NN ,/, pistachios/NN ,/, almond/NN etc/UH etc./LS ./. It/PRP tastes/VBZ a/DT bit/NN like/IN those/DT crumbly/JJ peanut/NN biscuits/NN that/IN we/PRP served/VBD during/IN Chinese/NNP New/NNP Year/NNP ./. Very/DT tasty/JJ but/CC very/RB sweet/JJ ./. Good/JJ for/IN those/DT with/IN a/DT sweet/JJ tooth/NN ./. Cheese/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB important/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT Jewish/JJ diet/NN as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT form/NN of/IN protein/NN that/WDT is/VBZ kosher/RB ./. Because/JJ Jewish/NN laws/NN do/VB not/RB permit/VB the/DT mixing/NN of/IN meat/NN with/IN dairy/NN ,/, they/PRP would/MD often/RB eat/VB cheese/NN instead/RB of/IN meat/NN ./. So/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB surprising/JJ that/IN Basher/NN 's/POS Fromagerie/NN has/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT largest/NN selection/NN of/IN cheeses/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ./. Here/RB you/PRP can/MD find/VB 800/IN different/JJ cheese/NN from/IN all/DT around/IN the/DT world/NN !/. And/CC ,/, you/PRP can/MD walk/VB into/IN the/DT shop/NN and/CC do/VB a/DT sampling/NN for/IN a/DT small/JJ fee/NN !/. We/PRP got/VBD to/TO try/VB the/DT pesto/JJ infused/NN gouda/NN which/WRB was/VBD very/RB interesting/JJ ./. My/PRP$ favorite/NN was/VBD the/DT Gruyere/NN which/WDT was/VBD sweet/JJ and/CC nutty/JJ ./. They/PRP also/RB showed/VBD us/PRP$ a/DT 12/CD year/NN old/JJ Gouda/NN which/WDT was/VBD packed/VBN with/IN umami/NN !/. Basher/DT 's/POS Fromagerie/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT stops/VBZ included/VBN in/IN the/DT prepaid/NN ticket/NN ,/, so/RB it/PRP make/VB sense/NN to/TO go/VB online/NN and/CC buy/VB these/DT before/IN you/PRP visit/VB !/. Read/JJ Part/. I/PRP ,/, Part/IN 2/CD and/CC Part/VBD 4/CD of/IN my/PRP$ Israel/NN Food/NN Trip/NN !/. This/DT trip/NN was/VBD sponsored/RB by/IN Taste/NN of/IN Israel/NN </text>
