<title>Maeda: Unpretentious, Casual Kaiseki style cuisine</title>
<text>Situated/JJ along/IN Joo/NNP Chiat/NNP Road/NNP ,/, you/PRP might/VB just/RB mistake/NN this/DT small/JJ little/JJ Japanese/NN restaurant/NN as/IN a/DT massage/JJ parlor/NN if/IN you/PRP did/VBD n't/RB know/VB any/DT better/NN ./. Maeda/PRP has/VB been/VB around/RB for/IN almost/RB two/CD years/NNS and/CC occupies/VBD the/DT shophouse/NN where/WRB Aston/NNP Prime/NNP used/VBD to/TO be/VB ./. So/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT location/NN I/PRP am/VBP most/RB familiar/JJ with/IN ,/, having/VBG organized/IN a/DT Charity/JJ Makan/NN session/NN there/RB in/IN the/DT early/NN days/NNS of/IN the/DT blog/NN ./. The/DT place/NN is/VBZ still/RB under/IN Aston/NNP 's/POS name/NN but/CC he/PRP has/VB leased/VB it/PRP out/VB to/TO Chef/NN Maeda/NN to/TO run/VB his/PRP$ little/JJ restaurant/NN that/WDT serves/VBZ up/RB casual/JJ Osakan/NN style/NN cuisine/NN ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB Kaiseki/JJ cuisine/NN in/IN the/DT strict/NN sense/NN of/IN the/DT word/NN ,/, but/CC then/RB Kaiseki/VBD in/IN Singapore/NNP tends/NN to/TO be/VB less/JJ formal/NN than/IN what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN Japan/NNP ./. But/CC by/IN labeling/NNP ``/NNP Casual/NNP Kaiseki/NNP ''/NNP -LRB-/NNP my/PRP$ own/JJ labeling/NN -RRB-/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP trying/VBG to/TO convey/VB that/IN sense/NN of/IN a/DT degustation/JJ type/NN meal/NN with/IN many/JJ different/JJ small/JJ dishes/NNS reflecting/IN the/DT seasonal/NN produce/NN of/IN Japan/NNP ,/, but/CC without/IN the/DT strict/NN formality/NN ./. The/DT place/NN is/VBZ run/NN by/IN Chef/NN Maeda/NN and/CC his/PRP$ sister/NN Nami/NN who/WP both/DT hail/NN from/IN Osaka/NN and/CC most/NN of/IN the/DT produce/NN has/VBZ been/VBN sourced/RB from/IN Japan/NNP ./. This/DT and/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ situated/RB in/IN a/DT nondescript/JJ little/JJ shophouse/NN really/RB makes/VBZ it/PRP feel/VB very/RB authentic/JJ from/IN the/DT start/VB ./. The/DT other/JJ attraction/NN is/VBZ their/PRP$ non-scary/NN prices/NN ./. As/IN you/PRP are/VBP well/RB aware/JJ ,/, uttering/IN the/DT phrase/NN ``/NN Omakase/NN ''/NN at/IN a/DT Japanese/NN restaurant/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP mean/VB that/WDT you/PRP hit/VB your/PRP$ credit/NNP card/NNP limit/NNP at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT meal/NN ./. So/IN my/PRP$ Omakase/NN meal/NN of/IN 8/CD courses/NN ,/, priced/VBD at/IN $/$ 120/CD +/NN +/NN per/NN pax/NN was/VBD quite/RB reasonable/JJ for/IN Singapore/NNP standards/NN ./. After/IN our/PRP$ starter/NN of/IN Canadian/JJ oyster/NN and/CC seafood/NN salad/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD presented/VBD with/IN the/DT sashimi/NNP platter/NNP -LRB-/NNP Mukozuke/NNP in/IN Kaiseki/NNP terms/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. This/DT course/NN of/IN raw/JJ fish/NN is/VBZ often/RB used/VBD as/IN an/DT initial/jj gauge/NN for/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN any/DT Japanese/NN restaurant/NN and/CC the/DT most/NN telling/VBG sign/NN is/VBZ often/JJ not/RB the/DT seafood/NN itself/PRP but/CC the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT wasabi/NN that/IN accompanies/JJ the/DT meal/NN ./. A/DT sharkskin/JJ board/NN lying/NN somewhere/NN on/IN the/DT chef/NN 's/POS table/NN top/NN indicates/NN that/IN the/DT chef/NN is/VBZ probably/RB grating/VBD his/PRP$ own/JJ wasabi/NN which/WRB means/VBZ that/IN he/PRP takes/VBZ his/PRP$ sashimi/NN quite/RB seriously/RB ./. Even/RB better/JJR if/IN he/PRP tells/VBZ you/PRP that/WDT his/PRP$ wasabi/NN is/VBZ from/IN Shizuoka/JJ prefecture/NN which/WDT is/VBZ where/RB the/DT best/JJS wasabi/NN in/IN Japan/NNP comes/VBZ from/IN ./. The/DT sashimi/NN was/VBD beautifully/JJ presented/VBD and/CC most/NN of/IN the/DT items/NNS were/VBD excellent/JJ ,/, with/IN the/DT exception/NN of/IN the/DT chutoro/NN which/WDT I/PRP felt/VBD could/MD have/VB been/VBN better/NN ./. There/EX were/VBD a/DT few/JJ more/JJ unique/JJ fish/NN like/IN the/DT lightly/NN grilled/VBN -LRB-/NNP aburi/NNP -RRB-/NNP Tachuo/NNP -LRB-/NNP scabbard/NNP fish/NN -RRB-/NN which/WRB was/VBD excellent/JJ as/IN was/VBD the/DT madai/NNP -LRB-/NNP Sea/NNP bream/NNP -RRB-/NNP presented/VBD in/IN 4.25/NN \//NN 5/CD Spring/NN is/VBZ the/DT season/NN for/IN bamboo/NN shoots/NN and/CC our/PRP$ takenoko/JJ -LRB-/NNP bamboo/NNP shoot/NNP -RRB-/NNP was/VBD presented/VBD very/RB simply/JJ by/IN boiling/JJ first/JJ followed/NN by/IN a/DT light/JJ grill/NN before/IN serving/VBG with/IN a/DT sumiso/NN sauce/NN made/VBD from/IN vinegar/NN ,/, sugar/NN and/CC miso/NN ./. It/PRP might/VB be/VB simple/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT dishes/NNS which/WRB I/PRP really/RB enjoyed/VBN ./. When/WRB our/PRP$ tempura/JJ dish/NN was/VBD presented/VBD ,/, I/PRP immediately/VB assumed/VB it/PRP was/VBD tempura/JJ ebi/NN and/CC was/VBD pleasantly/RB surprised/VBN when/WRB it/PRP turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB fried/VBD crab/NN legs/NNS instead/RB ./. The/DT homemade/NN tempura/NN batter/NN was/VBD light/JJ ,/, crisp/JJ and/CC not/RB too/RB oily/JJ ./. However/RB ,/, I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN better/JJR if/IN the/DT batter/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ thinner/NN such/NN that/WDT there/EX was/VBD more/JJ crab/NN meat/NN to/TO batter/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD still/RB enjoyable/JJ though/IN ./. 4\/5/. We/PRP were/VBD told/JJ that/IN our/PRP$ Chawanmushi/NN was/VBD supposed/JJ to/TO be/VB topped/VBD with/IN black/NN truffles/NN but/CC the/DT shipment/NN got/VBD held/VBD up/RB ,/, so/IN chef/NN substituted/NN with/IN with/IN foie/NN gras/NN ./. The/DT chawanmushi/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ and/CC was/VBD nicely/RB paired/JJ with/IN the/DT foie/NN gras/NN ./. Unfortunately/RB ,/, I/PRP felt/VBD the/DT texture/NN of/IN the/DT foie/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ too/RB firm/JJ as/IN it/PRP had/VBD been/VBN seared/VBD first/JJ and/CC then/RB steamed/JJ ./. Would/MD have/VB been/VBN better/JJR if/IN it/PRP had/VBD retained/IN its/PRP$ creamy/JJ texture/NN ./. 4\/5/JJ Rockfish/NN is/VBZ very/RB popular/JJ amongst/NN the/DT Japanese/NN and/CC subsequently/RB ,/, they/PRP can/MD be/VB quite/RB expensive/RB here/RB in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. I/PRP must/VB admit/VB that/IN I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB eaten/VBN enough/RB of/IN this/DT fish/NN to/TO actually/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO tell/VB the/DT difference/NN between/IN it/PRP and/CC say/VB ,/, a/DT coral/NN trout/NN ./. I/PRP felt/VBD the/DT texture/NN of/IN the/DT flesh/NN is/VBZ quite/RB similar/JJ so/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB sure/VB if/IN I/PRP can/MD appreciate/VB the/DT taste/NN enough/RB to/TO specially/RB pay/VB the/DT premium/NN for/IN it/PRP ./. But/CC the/DT fish/NN is/VBZ impressive/RB when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ presented/VBD ,/, especially/RB with/IN its/PRP$ big/JJ googly/NN muppet/NNS like/IN eyes/JJ and/CC bright/JJ red/JJ color/NN ./. Chef/NN simply/IN grilled/VBN it/PRP with/IN salt/NN to/TO preserve/VB its/PRP$ natural/JJ flavors/NNS ./. 4\/5/JJ If/IN you/PRP love/VBP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP and/CC especially/RB Ipoh/JJ Kway/NNP Teow/NNP ,/, then/RB this/DT bowl/NN of/IN thin/JJ udon/NN will/MD put/VB will/VB simply/VB blow/VB you/PRP away/RB ./. Thin/JJ udon/NN is/VBZ a/DT specialty/NN of/IN the/DT Akita/JJ prefecture/NNS where/WRB they/PRP grow/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN rice/NN and/CC this/DT is/VBZ possibly/RB the/DT best/JJS kway/NNP teow/NNP -LRB-/NNP udon/NNP really/RB -RRB-/. I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB eaten/VBN ./. The/DT texture/NN was/VBD simply/RB perfect/JJ and/CC it/PRP was/VBD so/RB light/JJ in/IN the/DT broth/NN ./. My/PRP$ only/JJ complaint/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP was/VBD the/DT last/JJ dish/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD so/RB full/JJ already/RB !/. The/DT broth/NN and/CC the/DT Wagyu/NN beef/NN stew/NN were/VBD excellent/JJ accompaniments/NNS !/. This/DT dish/NN felt/VBD like/IN a/DT Japanese/NN interpretation/NN of/IN our/PRP$ Beef/NN Kway/NNP Teow/NNP soup/NN !/. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD Conclusion/NN Great/JJ place/NN to/TO enjoy/VB a/DT quiet/JJ Japanese/NN meal/NN without/IN bursting/JJ the/DT pocket/NN ./. The/DT setting/NN is/VBZ simple/JJ and/CC aside/JJ from/IN Chef/NN and/CC his/PRP$ sister/NN ,/, there/RB might/VB be/VB only/RB another/DT one/CD or/CC two/CD persons/NNS working/VBG in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ,/, so/RB it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB personal/JJ ./. My/PRP$ only/JJ grouse/NN was/VBD that/IN it/PRP could/MD be/VB a/DT little/JJ cosier/NN as/IN the/DT place/NN does/VBZ seems/VBZ to/TO come/VB across/IN as/IN a/DT little/JJ bare/NN ./. Thanks/JJ to/TO Aston/NNP for/IN hosting/IN the/DT meal/NN !/. Maeda/NNP 467/NNP Joo/NNP Chiat/NNP Road/NNP Singapore/NNP 427678/NNP 63450745/NNP Open/NN for/IN Dinner/NN only/RB </text>
