<title>Yee Kee Specialist Roasted Duck: Sio Bak Heaven</title>
<text>Sio/NNP Bak/NNP ,/, so/RB simple/JJ ,/, so/RB primal/JJ ,/, so/RB shiok/JJ ./. Sio/NNP Bak/NNP really/RB celebrates/VB the/DT pure/JJ flavor/NN of/IN pork/NN since/IN it/PRP is/VBZ simply/JJ pork/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN salted/VBN and/CC roasted/NN ./. The/DT beauty/NN of/IN Sio/NNP Bak/NNP is/VBZ that/RB with/IN one/CD bite/VB ,/, you/PRP can/MD taste/VB the/DT nutty/JJ flavors/NNS of/IN the/DT meat/NN combined/NN with/IN the/DT crispy/NN texture/NN of/IN the/DT rind/JJ melded/NN with/IN the/DT pork/NN fat/NN which/WDT is/VBZ roasted/JJ till/NN it/PRP only/RB takes/VB the/DT warmth/NN of/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN and/CC a/DT few/JJ chews/NN to/TO create/VB perfect/JJ porcine/NN pleasure/NN for/IN your/PRP$ palate/NN ./. Ahh/WP .../: why/WRB does/VBZ something/NN so/RB good/JJ have/VBN to/TO be/VB soooo/RB bad/JJ for/IN you/PRP ?/. Having/VBG said/JJ that/WDT ,/, it/PRP really/RB does/VB take/VB skill/NN to/TO create/VB the/DT perfect/JJ Sio/NNP Bak/NNP ./. The/DT most/NN important/JJ ingredient/NN is/VBZ of/IN course/NN the/DT pork/NN which/WDT is/VBZ where/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN hawkers/NNS hit/IN the/DT first/JJ road/NN block/JJ ./. In/IN the/DT good/JJ old/JJ days/NNS ,/, we/PRP used/VBD to/TO have/VB our/PRP$ own/JJ pig/NNP farms/NNP in/IN Punggol/NNP and/CC those/RB were/VBD the/DT glory/NN days/NNS for/IN the/DT Sio/NNP Bak/NNP men/NNP ./. Pigs/PRP ate/VBD very/RB well/RB then/RB ./. They/PRP basically/RB ate/VBD what/WP you/PRP and/CC I/PRP ate/VBD ,/, or/CC more/RB precisely/RB whatever/PRP is/VBZ leftover/JJ after/IN we/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN ./. Swill/PRP might/VB be/VB the/DT stuff/NN that/IN commandos/NN use/VB in/IN initiating/DT new/JJ recruits/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP were/VBD prized/JJ feed/VB for/IN pigs/NNS ./. Can/VBP you/PRP imagine/VB the/DT difference/NN between/IN pigs/NNS that/WDT ate/VBD rice/NN ,/, meat/NN and/CC veggies/NN compared/VBD to/TO ones/NNS that/WDT eat/VB processed/RB feeds/RB made/VBD from/IN who/WP knows/VBZ what/WP ?/. Of/IN course/NN ,/, nowadays/RB we/PRP do/VB have/VB kurobuta/JJ pork/NN which/WRB I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ would/MD make/VB heavenly/NNP Sio/NNP Bak/NNP ,/, but/CC which/WRB hawker/NN would/MD have/VB the/DT guts/NN to/TO introduce/VB such/RB a/DT dish/NN to/TO a/DT price/NN sensitive/NN market/NN ?/. Thus/NNP ,/, Kurobuta/NNP Sio/NNP Bak/NNP is/VBZ only/RB reserved/JJ for/IN posh/NN restaurants/NN and/CC hawkers/NNS have/VBN to/TO make/VB do/VB with/IN fresh/JJ Indonesian/NN pork/NN ,/, which/WRB I/PRP am/VBP told/JJ is/VBZ inferior/RB to/TO Malaysian/JJ pork/NN which/WDT is/VBZ still/RB banned/VBD in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. But/CC some/DT hawkers/NNS made/VBD do/VB with/IN whatever/PRP they/PRP can/MD get/VB their/PRP$ hands/NNS on/IN and/CC still/RB make/VB an/DT excellent/JJ dish/NN given/VBN the/DT limitations/NN ./. The/DT Sio/NNP Bak/NNP at/IN Yee/NNP Kee/NNP is/VBZ just/RB one/CD such/NN example/NN ./. As/IN I/PRP said/JJ in/IN the/DT beginning/VBG of/IN this/DT post/NN ,/, Sio/NNP Bak/NNP is/VBZ actually/RB a/DT very/RB simple/JJ dish/NN ./. All/PDT you/PRP need/NN is/VBZ good/JJ quality/NN pork/NN belly/NN ,/, salt/NN ,/, pepper/NN and/CC five/CD spice/NN powder/NN ./. As/CC with/IN all/DT simple/JJ recipes/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ often/RB difficult/JJ to/TO get/VB right/NN because/IN you/PRP really/RB need/VB to/TO focus/VB on/IN the/DT technique/NN ./. Without/IN the/DT attention/NN to/TO details/NNS ,/, the/DT rind/NN will/MD be/VB tough/JJ and/CC chewy/JJ and/CC the/DT meat/NN dry/JJ and/CC lifeless/JJ ./. But/CC after/IN many/JJ years/NNS of/IN experience/NN ,/, this/DT uncle/NN manages/NN to/TO get/VB the/DT Sio/NNP Bak/NNP to/TO have/VB a/DT nice/JJ crispy/NN rind/NN and/CC juicy/NN ,/, tender/NN meat/NN that/IN still/RB retains/NN that/IN springy/NN chew/NN ./. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD Two/NN other/JJ things/NNS that/IN really/RB impress/VB me/PRP about/IN this/DT stall/NN are/VBZ the/DT rice/NN and/CC the/DT soup/NN ./. These/DT are/VBP two/CD things/NNS that/IN most/NN other/JJ stalls/NN overlook/NN ./. When/WRB you/PRP are/VBP ordering/VBG your/PRP$ rice/NN ,/, just/RB take/VB a/DT look/VB at/IN how/WRB they/PRP keep/VB the/DT rice/NN warm/JJ ./. They/PRP actually/RB keep/VB the/DT rice/NN in/IN a/DT large/JJ clay/NN pot/NN and/CC place/NN some/NN charcoal/NN at/IN the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT pot/NN ./. Frankly/JJ ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB sure/VB if/IN it/PRP made/VBD the/DT rice/NN taste/NN better/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP do/VBP admire/RB the/DT stallholder/NN 's/POS insistence/NN on/IN doing/VBG it/PRP the/DT traditional/JJ way/NN ./. At/IN most/JJ other/JJ stalls/NNS you/PRP would/MD also/RB be/VB expected/VBN to/TO pay/VB for/IN some/DT double/JJ boiled/NN soup/NN ,/, but/CC at/IN Yee/NNP Kee/NNP ,/, they/PRP actually/RB provide/VB some/DT really/RB nice/JJ Cantonese/JJ style/NN soup/NN for/IN free/JJ !/. They/PRP have/VBP different/JJ flavors/NNS and/CC the/DT soup/NN is/VBZ easily/RB the/DT best/JJS free/JJ soup/NN I/PRP have/VBP taken/VBN ./. The/DT Char/NNP Siew/NNP here/RB is/VBZ not/RB as/IN sweet/JJ as/IN I/PRP would/MD like/VB it/PRP to/TO be/VB but/CC I/PRP suspect/VBD that/IN Char/NNP Siew/NNP was/VBD probably/RB not/RB as/IN sweet/JJ in/IN the/DT past/IN as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ nowadays/RB ./. I/PRP am/VBP just/RB postulating/JJ since/IN this/DT stall/NN has/VBZ been/VBN around/RB for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN and/CC they/PRP claim/VBD that/IN they/PRP always/RB served/VBD Char/NNP Siew/NNP like/IN this/DT ./. It/PRP is/VBZ closer/JJ to/TO the/DT style/NN of/IN Char/NNP Siew/NNP that/WDT you/PRP find/VB in/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP restaurants/NN like/IN Crystal/NN Jade/NN ,/, so/RB perhaps/IN the/DT sweeter/NN Char/NNP Siew/NNP is/VBZ more/RB of/IN a/DT Singaporean/JJ style/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD roasted/RB perfectly/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBD it/PRP a/DT little/JJ sweeter/NN and/CC stickier/NN ./. 4\/5/JJ Although/CC the/DT stall/NN claims/NN to/TO specialize/VB in/IN Roast/NNP Duck/NNP ,/, we/PRP actually/RB found/VBD the/DT Roast/NNP duck/NN to/TO be/VB quite/RB unremarkable/JJ ./. Perhaps/RB we/PRP have/VBN to/TO be/VB there/RB when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ out/IN of/IN the/DT oven/NN fresh/JJ ./. Anyone/RB a/DT fan/NN of/IN the/DT roast/NN duck/NN here/RB ?/. 3.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD Conclusion/NN This/DT is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN for/IN old/JJ school/NN roast/NN meats/NNS ,/, especially/RB the/DT Sio/NNP Bak/NNP ./. Any/RB long/JJ time/NN fans/NNS here/RB among/IN our/PRP$ readers/NNS who/WP can/MD tell/VB us/PRP a/DT bit/NN more/NN about/IN how/WRB they/PRP were/VBD when/WRB they/PRP were/VBD still/RB located/VBD at/IN Lavender/NNP Street/NNP ?/.
