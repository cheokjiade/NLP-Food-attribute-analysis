<title>Whampoa Keng Fishhead Steamboat: One Man, Two Wives and Fish Head Steamboat</title>
<text>Fishhead/JJ steamboat/NN ./. Is/WBZ this/DT another/JJ uniquely/NN Singaporean/NN dish/NN or/CC did/VBD it/PRP come/VB from/IN China/NNP ?/. Doris/JJ ,/, the/DT lao/NNP ban/NNP niang/NNP -LRB-/NNP lady/NNP boss/NNP -RRB-/NNP at/IN Whampoa/NNP Keng/NNP ,/, tells/VBZ me/PRP that/IN she/PRP remembers/VBP eating/VBG this/DT style/NN of/IN steamboat/NN when/WRB she/PRP was/VBD still/RB a/DT kid/NN living/NN in/IN the/DT Char/NNP Jung/NNP Tao/NNP area/NN -LRB-/IN lit/NNP Wooden/NNP Ship/NNP Port/NNP ie/IN Clarke/NNP Quay/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. Back/RB then/RB ,/, the/DT most/NN famous/JJ stall/NN selling/VBG Fishhead/NNP Steamboat/NNP was/VBD Nam/NNP Wah/NNP Chang/NNP who/WP started/VBD selling/VBG Fishhead/NNP Steamboat/NNP way/NN back/RB in/IN 1927/NN ./. They/PRP were/VBD probably/RB the/DT originators/NN of/IN this/DT quintessentially/NNP Teochew/NNP dish/NN which/WRB has/VBZ its/PRP$ roots/NN in/IN Swatow/NNP ,/, China/NNP ./. But/CC is/VBZ the/DT way/NN it/PRP is/VBZ served/VBD in/IN a/DT steamboat/NN with/IN the/DT fried/JJ yam/NN ,/, sour/NN plums/NN ,/, fried/VBD solefish/NN ,/, Tang/NNP Orh/NNP and/CC Peh/NNP Chye/NNP -LRB-/NNP Chinese/NNP Cabbage/NNP -RRB-/NNP something/NN that/WDT is/VBZ found/VBN in/IN Swatow/NNP ?/. Would/MD those/DT readers/NNS familiar/JJ with/IN Swatow/JJ cuisine/NN please/NN let/VB us/PRP know/VB ?/. Whenever/VBP you/PRP order/VB Fishhead/VB Steamboat/RB ,/, you/PRP are/VBP faced/JJ with/IN a/DT choice/NN ./. Will/VBP you/PRP order/VB the/DT Grouper/NN or/CC the/DT Pomfret/JJ ?/. Will/VBP you/PRP order/VB fish/NN head/NN or/CC sliced/VBN fish/NN meat/NN ?/. Well/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP visited/RB Whampoa/JJ Keng/NN twice/NN and/CC ordered/VBD both/DT versions/NN and/CC my/PRP$ preference/NN is/VBZ for/IN the/DT Pomfret/NN ./. As/IN you/PRP know/VBP ,/, Teochews/PRP love/VBP Pomfret/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP am/VBP not/RB being/VBG biased/NN just/RB because/IN I/PRP happen/VBP to/TO be/VB a/DT Teochew/NNP Ah/NN Hia/IN -LRB-/NNP Teochew/NNP brother/NN -RRB-/NN ./. Whampoa/DT Keng/NN uses/VBZ Dao/NNP Chior/NNP -LRB-/NNP Chinese/NNP Pomfret/NNP -RRB-/NN for/IN the/DT soup/NN which/WDT is/VBZ more/RB expensive/JJ than/IN Peh/NNP Chior/NNP -LRB-/NNP Silver/NNP Pomfret/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. The/DT Dao/NN Chior/NN is/VBZ a/DT larger/JJ fish/NN ,/, so/RB the/DT flesh/NN is/VBZ more/RB substantial/JJ and/CC better/NN for/IN soups/NN ./. Whampoa/DT Keng/NN does/VBZ n't/RB make/VB a/DT distinction/NN between/IN fish/NN head/NN and/CC sliced/VBN fish/NN ,/, so/RB you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO worry/VB about/IN having/VBG to/TO make/VB that/IN decision/NN ./. But/CC in/IN general/NN ,/, soup/NN made/VBD from/IN fish/NN head/NN is/VBZ sweeter/NN and/CC if/IN you/PRP enjoy/VB sucking/NN on/IN soft/JJ jellylike/NN bits/NNS ,/, then/RB go/VB for/IN the/DT head/NN ./. However/RB ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO Pomfret/NN ,/, the/DT head/NN is/VBZ so/RB small/JJ that/IN no/RB one/CD really/RB offers/VBZ pomfret/JJ head/NN soup/NN ,/, unless/NN you/PRP are/VBP serving/VBG the/DT Emperor/NN of/IN China/NNP ./. Ah/NN ,/, here/RB is/VBZ another/DT decision/NN you/PRP have/VB to/TO make/VB ./. What/WP do/VBP you/PRP do/VB with/IN the/DT fried/JJ yam/NN ?/. Eat/VBP it/PRP just/RB like/VB that/WDT or/CC mash/VB it/PRP up/RB and/CC drink/VB it/PRP with/IN the/DT soup/NN ?/. Lao/NNP Ban/NNP Niang/NNP 's/POS personal/JJ preference/NN is/VBZ the/DT mash/NN it/PRP up/VB and/CC drink/VB it/PRP with/IN the/DT soup/NN and/CC having/VBG tried/VBD it/PRP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP very/RB much/RB in/IN agreement/NN with/IN the/DT Teochew/NNP Ah/NN Nia/IN -LRB-/NNP Teochew/NNP lady/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. The/DT ingredients/NNS might/VB seem/NNS like/IN a/DT random/JJ mix/NN of/IN fish/NN and/CC other/JJ stuff/NN but/CC according/NN to/TO Doris/VB ,/, each/JJ ingredient/NN plays/VBZ an/DT important/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT overall/NN taste/NN of/IN the/DT soup/NN ,/, so/RB it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT attention/NN to/TO the/DT little/JJ details/NNS which/WRB produces/VBZ a/DT soup/NN that/WDT is/VBZ well/RB balanced/VBN ./. Take/VB the/DT sour/JJ plums/NN for/IN instance/NN ,/, there/RB may/MD only/RB be/VB one/CD or/CC two/CD per/NN pot/NN ,/, but/CC if/IN omitted/NN ,/, the/DT soup/NN will/MD lack/VB that/IN little/JJ tang/NN that/WDT helps/VBZ get/VB your/PRP$ salivary/NNP glands/NNP going/NN ./. Needless/JJ to/TO say/VB ,/, the/DT fish/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB really/RB fresh/JJ and/CC the/DT yam/NN has/VBZ to/TO come/VB from/IN Thailand/NNP where/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ ``/JJ Shang/NNP shang/NNP ''/NNP -LRB-/NNP powdery/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. All/PDT of/IN our/PRP$ kakis/NNS agree/VB that/IN the/DT soup/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ ./. 4.5/NNP \//NNP 5/LS Now/RB ,/, you/PRP might/VB be/VB a/DT little/JJ confused/VBD with/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN steamboat/JJ places/NNS name/NN Whampoa/NN and/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB blame/VB you/PRP ./. So/RB to/TO clear/VB up/IN the/DT confusion/NN ,/, here/RB is/VBZ the/DT story/NN ./. Before/IN Whampoa/NN market/NN and/CC food/NN center/NN was/VBD renovated/RB ,/, there/RB were/VBD three/CD stalls/NNS there/RB selling/VBG Fishhead/NN steamboat/NN ./. Our/PRP$ Lao/JJ Ban/NN Niang/NN started/VBD by/IN selling/VBG Kway/NNP Chap/NNP before/IN changing/VBG to/TO Fish/NNP Head/NNP Steamboat/NN and/CC she/PRP was/VBD the/DT latest/JJS of/IN the/DT three/CD stalls/NNS there/RB ./. Of/IN the/DT three/CD stalls/NNS ,/, two/CD were/VBD more/RB popular/JJ ./. The/DT original/JJ Fishhead/NN Steamboat/NN stall/NN which/WRB occupied/VBZ the/DT fresh/JJ food/NN market/NN side/NN and/CC hers/NN ./. When/WRB they/PRP closed/VBD the/DT market/NN for/IN renovations/NN ,/, they/PRP moved/VBD to/TO their/PRP$ own/JJ premises/NNS at/IN Balestier/NNP and/CC renamed/VB it/PRP Whampoa/RB Keng/VBD ,/, Keng/RB being/VBG the/DT name/NN of/IN the/DT golden/JJ haired/NN anime/IN looking/VBG Lao/NNP Ban/NNP -LRB-/NNP Boss/NNP -RRB-/NNP who/WP not/RB only/RB has/VB to/TO look/VB after/IN two/CD restaurants/NNS ,/, but/CC two/CD wives/NNS as/IN well/RB ./. More/DT about/IN him/PRP later/NN ./. Now/JJ ,/, you/PRP would/MD n't/RB want/VB to/TO just/RB come/VB here/RB to/TO drink/VB soup/NN right/NN ?/. You/PRP also/RB want/VB to/TO order/VB a/DT few/JJ dishes/NNS which/WRB are/VBP preferably/JJ deep/JJ fried/JJ -LRB-/NN since/IN fish/NN soup/NN is/VBZ so/RB healthy/JJ ,/, you/PRP need/VBP some/JJ deep/JJ fried/VBD stuff/NN to/TO balance/VB your/PRP$ diet/NN -RRB-/NN ./. They/PRP have/VB a/DT few/JJ signature/JJ dishes/NNS here/RB which/WRB we/PRP tried/VBD ./. One/PRP was/VBD the/DT ever/RB popular/JJ Har/NN Cheong/NN Gai/NN -LRB-/NN prawn/NN paste/NN chicken/NN -RRB-/NN which/WRB was/VBD well/RB marinated/VBD ,/, hot/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ ./. The/DT marinade/NN is/VBZ very/RB balance/NN and/CC it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN perfect/JJ if/IN the/DT coating/NN of/IN batter/NN were/VBD just/RB a/DT bit/NN more/RB even/RB ./. Most/JJS of/IN our/PRP$ kakis/NNS also/RB liked/VBD their/PRP$ handmade/JJ Ngor/NN Hiang/NN which/WRB was/VBD made/VBD with/IN fresh/JJ sea/NN prawns/NNS that/IN they/PRP de-shell/VBP themselves/RB ./. The/DT meat/NN and/CC prawn/NN filling/NN was/VBD plump/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ and/CC even/RB though/IN the/DT prawns/NNS were/VBD minced/RB a/DT bit/NN too/RB fine/JJ for/IN my/PRP$ liking/VBG ,/, the/DT crunchiness/NN of/IN the/DT water/NN chestnut/NN more/RB than/RB made/VBD up/RP for/IN it/PRP ./. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD We/PRP were/VBD recommended/JJ to/TO try/VB the/DT Indonesian/JJ chicken/NN which/WDT is/VBZ deep/JJ fried/VBD nuggets/NN of/IN chicken/NN coated/VBN with/IN a/DT sweet/JJ ,/, sour/JJ and/CC spicy/JJ prawn/NN paste/NN sauce/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ good/JJ as/IN the/DT chicken/NN pieces/NNS were/VBD fried/VBD fresh/JJ so/RB that/IN they/PRP were/VBD still/RB plump/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ ./. Aside/RB from/IN the/DT Indonesian/JJ style/NN sauce/NN ,/, the/DT marmite/NN sauce/NN is/VBZ also/RB great/JJ and/CC you/PRP can/MD choose/VB pork/NN ribs/NNS or/CC chicken/NN ./. You/PRP can/MD mix/VB and/CC match/VB any/RB of/IN these/DT combination/NN and/CC they/PRP will/VB satisfy/VB your/PRP$ craving/NN for/IN deep/JJ fried/VBD meat/NN in/IN sweet/JJ ,/, sour/JJ ,/, savory/JJ and/CC spicy/JJ sauce/NN ./. Personally/RB I/PRP preferred/VBD the/DT marmite/NN sauce/NN over/IN the/DT Indonesian/NN sauce/NN ./. 4\/5/. The/DT good/JJ thing/NN about/IN the/DT Salted/JJ Egg/NN Prawns/NN is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP use/VBP really/RB nice/JJ medium/NN sized/VBD prawns/NNS here/RB which/WDT are/VBP marinated/VBD in/IN ice/NN so/RB that/IN the/DT texture/NN is/VBZ nice/JJ and/CC crunchy/JJ ./. However/RB ,/, the/DT salted/VBD egg/NN sauce/NN lacked/VBZ a/DT certain/JJ kick/VB that/WDT I/PRP enjoy/VB when/WRB eating/NN salted/VBD egg/NN ./. It/PRP would/MD also/RB have/VB been/VBN nicer/JJ if/IN the/DT batter/NN would/MD remain/VB crispy/NN with/IN the/DT coating/NN of/IN the/DT sauce/NN ./. 3.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD Ah/NN yes/EX ,/, now/RB we/PRP come/VB to/TO the/DT story/NN of/IN Keng/NN and/CC his/PRP$ two/CD wives/NNS ./. This/DT is/VBZ probably/RB a/DT story/NN which/WDT the/DT ladies/NNS of/IN AWARE/NN would/MD frown/VB upon/IN and/CC I/PRP shall/VB state/VB very/RB clearly/RB from/IN the/DT start/VB that/WDT I/PRP am/VBD in/IN no/DT way/NN an/DT advocate/NN of/IN the/DT one/CD man/NN two/CD wives/NN policy/NN ./. -LRB-/IN My/PRP$ ear/NN is/VBZ hurting/JJ as/IN I/PRP write/VB this/DT ,/, ouch/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. Although/CC ,/, the/DT story/NN of/IN a/DT male/JJ patriach/NN with/IN a/DT wife/NN and/CC a/DT number/NN of/IN ``/NNP Siao/NNP Lao/NNP Puo/NNP ''/NNP -LRB-/NNP Small/NNP wives/NNP -RRB-/NNP is/VBZ quite/RB common/VBN in/IN the/DT good/JJ old/JJ days/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB quite/RB so/RB common/VBN in/IN the/DT age/NN of/IN women/NN 's/POS rights/NN ./. What/WP amazed/VBD me/PRP about/IN the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ how/RB everyone/RB got/VBD along/IN together/RB so/RB well/RB ./. It/PRP turned/VBD out/IN that/IN Sharon/PRP had/VBD been/VBN visiting/VBG the/DT family/NN stall/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN and/CC got/VBD to/TO know/VB the/DT kids/NNS and/CC the/DT family/NN very/RB well/RB ./. After/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, Keng/NN asked/VBD Doris/RB if/IN it/PRP was/VBD ok/JJ for/IN him/PRP to/TO take/VB her/PRP as/IN a/DT second/JJ wife/NN ,/, to/TO which/WRB she/PRP was/VBD agreeable/RB !/. Even/RB the/DT son/NN ,/, Siro/NN -LRB-/NN pictured/NN left/JJ -RRB-/NN is/VBZ ok/JJ with/IN the/DT whole/JJ idea/NN !/. So/RB now/RB Doris/PRP runs/VBZ the/DT restaurant/NN at/IN Balestier/NNP ,/, Sharon/NNP is/VBZ in/IN charge/NN of/IN the/DT one/CD in/IN Rangoon/NN road/NN ./. Both/DT wives/JJ live/JJ in/IN separate/NN homes/NN and/CC Keng/NN shuttles/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD homes/NN spending/NN a/DT fraction/JJ more/NN time/NN with/IN wife/NN number/NN one/CD ./.
