<title>Kay Lee Roast Meat Joint: Move over Colonel Sanders, I also got 11 Herbs and Spices!</title>
<text>I/PRP am/VBP beginning/VBG to/TO realize/VB the/DT only/RB common/JJ thing/NN about/IN Char/NNP Siew/NNP is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ long/JJ strips/NN of/IN marinated/VBD meat/NN !/. No/JJ ,/, some/JJ people/NNS do/VBP n't/RB even/RB BBQ/NN their/PRP$ Char/NNP Siew/NNP and/CC it/PRP still/RB passes/VBD off/IN as/IN Char/NNP Siew/NNP ./. -LRB-/WP I/PRP am/VBP not/RB in/IN anyway/NN endorsing/IN this/DT ,/, but/CC I/PRP even/RB see/VB it/PRP in/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP !/. -RRB-/RB It/PRP does/VBZ not/RB have/VBN to/TO be/VB red/JJ in/IN color/NN ,/, some/DT are/VBP dark/JJ brown/JJ or/CC even/RB near/VB black/NN ./. And/CC the/DT number/NN of/IN recipes/NN for/IN Char/NNP Siew/NNP abounds/NNP ./. My/PRP$ last/JJ post/NN on/IN Char/NNP Siew/NNP featured/NNP a/DT Teochew/NNP style/NN Char/NNP Siew/NNP which/WDT uses/VBZ Tau/NNP Cheo/NNP -LRB-/NNP Fermented/NNP Beans/NNP -RRB-/NN and/CC malt/NN ./. The/DT Fatty/NN Cheong/IN Char/NNP Siew/NNP was/VBD an/DT Oyster/NN Sauce/NN and/CC caramelised/VBN sugar/NN version/NN ./. Now/RB I/PRP discover/VBP Kay/JJ Lee/NN 's/POS Zhu/NN Jiang/NN version/NN which/WRB uses/VBZ Yao/NNP Chai/NNP -LRB-/NNP Herbs/NNP -RRB-/NNP in/IN the/DT marinade/NN !/. The/DT Lao/NN Ban/NN Niang/NN is/VBZ a/DT colourful/JJ character/NN who/WP is/VBZ fiercely/RB passionate/JJ about/IN the/DT Zhu/JJ Jiang/NN heritage/NN of/IN her/PRP Char/NNP Siew/NNP and/CC Roast/NNP Duck/NNP ./. She/JJ insists/NN that/WDT she/PRP has/VBZ tasted/VBN all/PDT the/DT best/JJS Char/NNP Siew/NNP in/IN Singapore/NNP and/CC still/RB feels/JJ hers/NN is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS ./. ``/. We/PRP do/VBP n't/RB use/VB any/DT MSG/NN in/IN our/PRP$ marinade/NN !/. My/PRP$ sauce/NN is/VBZ the/DT only/RB one/CD of/IN its/PRP$ kind/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. When/WRB you/PRP taste/VB it/PRP ,/, it/PRP leaves/VBZ a/DT Karm/JJ Karm/NN -LRB-/NN Astringently/NN sweet/JJ is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS I/PRP can/MD describe/VB this/DT word/NN -RRB-/NN taste/NN in/IN your/PRP$ palate/NN ,/, AND/NN you/PRP never/RB get/VB thirsty/NN from/IN it/PRP !/. ''/RB She/JJ boldly/NN declared/NN ./. Even/RB the/DT method/NN of/IN chopping/VBG the/DT duck/NN is/VBZ special/JJ ./. She/JJ chops/NNS it/PRP diagonally/RB ,/, insisting/NN that/IN it/PRP makes/VBZ a/DT difference/NN to/TO the/DT texture/NN of/IN the/DT meat/NN ./. The/DT only/RB thing/NN I/PRP love/VBP more/JJR than/IN people/NN with/IN passion/NN is/VBZ expressive/JJ people/NN with/IN passion/NN !/. The/DT Char/NNP Siew/NNP here/RB is/VBZ very/RB shiok/JJ and/CC ,/, as/IN the/DT Lao/JJ Ban/NN Niang/NN said/JJ ,/, the/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ very/RB special/JJ ./. And/CC most/RB importantly/IN they/PRP use/VBP the/DT pork/NN ``/NN Armpit/NN ''/NN meat/NN which/WDT is/VBZ beautifully/JJ marbled/NN ./. It/PRP 's/POS wonderfully/NN tender/NN and/CC chewy/JJ at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./. SCS/JJ Butter/NN and/CC I/PRP had/VBD differing/RB opinions/JJ on/IN the/DT duck/NN ./. I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ ducks/NN I/PRP have/VBP tasted/VBN in/IN Singapore/NNP though/IN it/PRP still/RB lacks/VBZ that/IN extra/JJ ooompph/NN that/WDT I/PRP referred/VBD to/TO in/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ Roast/NNP Duck/NNP post/NNP ./. The/DT special/JJ thing/NN about/IN it/PRP though/CC ,/, is/VBZ that/IN the/DT skin/NN is/VBZ crispy/JJ which/WDT sets/VBZ it/PRP apart/RB from/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN other/JJ Roast/NNP Ducks/NNP ./. The/DT Sio/NNP Bak/NNP here/RB is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ./. The/DT skin/NN is/VBZ crispy/JJ and/CC the/DT meat/NN has/VBZ got/VBN enough/RB five/CD spice/NN and/CC salty/NN flavor/NN ./. Unfortunately/RB we/PRP ate/VBD it/PRP in/IN the/DT afternoon/NN so/IN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB fresh/VB out/IN of/IN the/DT oven/NN ./. It/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN even/RB better/JJR then/RB !/. The/DT steamed/JJ soup/NN here/RB is/VBZ excellent/JJ ./. I/PRP liked/VBD the/DT watercress/NN soup/NN just/RB slightly/RB more/JJR than/IN the/DT winter/NN melon/NN ./. Those/RB who/WP are/VBP fat/JJ conscious/NN should/MD skim/VB off/IN the/DT layer/NN of/IN fat/NN on/IN top/NN of/IN the/DT soup/NN which/WDT is/VBZ evidence/JJ of/IN how/RB long/JJ the/DT soup/NN has/VBZ been/VBN steamed/JJ ./. Lao/DT Ban/JJ Niang/NN claims/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP slow/JJ cooked/VBN for/IN 6-8/CD hours/NNS to/TO extract/VB all/PDT the/DT flavors/NNS ./. Again/RB she/PRP claims/VB that/IN no/DT MSG/NN is/VBZ added/VBD !/. With/IN the/DT soup/NN so/RB tasty/JJ ,/, I/PRP was/VBD of/IN course/NN a/DT bit/NN skeptical/NN ./. But/CC we/PRP all/RB can/MD say/VB that/WDT we/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB that/IN ``/NNP post/NNP MSG/NNP thirst/NNP ''/NNP that/WDT you/PRP usually/RB get/VB with/IN poor/JJ quality/NN MSG/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBP saved/VBN the/DT best/JJ for/IN last/JJ !/. This/DT is/VBZ my/PRP$ discovery/NN of/IN the/DT month/NN !/. Hakka/NNP Salt/NNP Chicken/NNP !/. I/PRP am/VBP not/RB sure/VB if/IN there/EX are/VBP other/JJ stalls/NNS in/IN Singapore/NNP that/WDT sells/VBZ this/DT but/CC this/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN the/DT 3/CD of/IN us/PRP were/VBD eating/VBG this/DT dish/NN ./. The/DT chicken/NN is/VBZ first/JJ boiled/NN then/RB roasted/NN ./. After/IN it/PRP is/VBZ chopped/VBN into/IN bite/VB sized/VBD pieces/NN ,/, a/DT special/JJ condiment/NN made/VBD from/IN fried/VBN garlic/NN ,/, ginger/NN and/CC lemongrass/NN is/VBZ liberally/JJ spooned/NN on/IN top/NN of/IN it/PRP ./. I/PRP think/VB God/VB must/VB have/VB made/VBD Chicken/NN and/CC Ginger/NN to/TO go/VB together/RB !/. Somehow/IN the/DT combination/NN just/RB tingles/IN the/DT tastebuds/NNS like/IN a/DT well/RB composed/JJ symphony/NN ./. First/RB bite/VB was/VBD a/DT ``/JJ Phwa/NN Sayah/NN ,/, where/RB have/VB you/PRP been/VB all/DT my/PRP$ life/NN ''/NN experience/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB come/VB all/IN the/DT way/NN from/IN Choa/NNP Chu/NNP Kang/NN for/IN the/DT Char/NNP Siew/NNP ,/, you/PRP must/MD come/VB for/IN this/DT chicken/NN !/. Excellent/JJ roasted/NN meat/NN with/IN a/DT unique/NN sauce/NN that/WDT is/VBZ not/RB commonly/RB found/VBD ./. The/DT hidden/JJ pearl/NN is/VBZ the/DT Hakka/NN Salt/NN Chicken/NN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT really/RB Must/VB Try/VB !/. </text>
