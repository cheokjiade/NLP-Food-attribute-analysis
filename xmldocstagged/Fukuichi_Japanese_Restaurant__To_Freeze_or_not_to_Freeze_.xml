<title>Fukuichi Japanese Restaurant: To Freeze or not to Freeze?</title>
<text>There/EX are/VBP basically/JJ two/CD types/NNS of/IN Sushi/NN Restaurants/NN ./. Those/NNS that/IN you/PRP have/VBP to/TO plan/VB for/IN months/NNS to/TO go/VB and/CC those/RB that/IN you/PRP just/RB drop/VBD in/IN whenever/NN you/PRP want/VB ./. Sushi/NN is/VBZ not/RB cheap/JJ because/IN it/PRP takes/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN effort/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT fish/NN is/VBZ ``/JJ Sashimi/NN Grade/NN ''/NN ./. So/RB what/WP exactly/RB is/VBZ ``/JJ Sashimi/NN Grade/NN ''/JJ fish/NN ?/. If/IN you/PRP try/VB to/TO buy/VB salmon/NN from/IN the/DT supermarket/NN ,/, you/PRP would/MD be/VB confronted/VBD with/IN the/DT warning/NN that/IN certain/NN salmon/NN are/VBP not/RB meant/VB to/TO be/VB eaten/VBN raw/JJ ./. There/EX actually/RB is/VBZ n't/RB any/RB authority/JJ that/IN grades/NNS the/DT fish/NN into/IN sashimi/JJ or/CC non-sashimi/JJ grade/NN fish/NN ./. So/RB really/RB ,/, we/PRP consumers/NNS are/VBP at/IN the/DT mercy/NN of/IN the/DT companies/NNS that/WDT sell/VB us/PRP these/DT products/NN ./. Raw/JJ fish/NN ,/, especially/RB fresh/JJ water/NN fish/NN ,/, can/MD potentially/RB harbor/VB parasites/NNS ./. Salmon/NN in/IN particular/JJ which/WRB spend/VBZ part/NN of/IN their/PRP$ lives/NN in/IN fresh/JJ water/NN are/VBP common/JJ hosts/NN for/IN the/DT tapeworm/NN larvae/NN ./. When/WRB ingested/NN ,/, the/DT tapeworm/NN makes/VBZ its/PRP$ home/NN in/IN our/JJ intestines/NNS where/WRB it/PRP can/MD grow/VB as/IN long/JJ as/IN 30/CD feet/NNS ./. The/DT parasite/NN can/MD be/VB killed/VBN by/IN freezing/VBG the/DT fish/NN to/TO minus/VB 35/NN degrees/NNS celcius/NNS for/IN 15/CD hours/NNS ./. In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT sushi/NN chefs/NN in/IN Japan/NNP are/VBP all/DT trained/NN to/TO serve/VB only/RB Salmon/NN which/WDT have/VB been/VBN frozen/JJ before/IN ./. So/RB when/WRB we/PRP talk/VB about/IN good/JJ quality/NN fish/NN ,/, it/PRP certainly/RB does/VBD not/RB mean/VB that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN frozen/JJ before/IN ./. The/DT other/JJ fish/NN that/WDT we/PRP all/RB love/VBP which/WDT has/VBZ probably/RB been/VBN frozen/JJ is/VBZ the/DT bluefin/JJ tuna/NN ./. Ninety/DT percent/NN of/IN all/DT tunas/NN caught/VBN have/VBN been/VBN blast/NN frozen/JJ when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP caught/VBN by/IN the/DT fishing/NN boats/NN ./. Since/IN the/DT fishing/NNP boats/NNP spend/NNP months/NNS at/IN sea/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB rare/JJ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO eat/VB tuna/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN freshly/RB caught/VBN ./. In/IN general/NN ,/, when/WRB meats/NNS are/VBP frozen/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ home/NN fridges/NN ,/, the/DT slow/JJ freezing/NN process/NN means/NN that/IN the/DT water/NN within/IN the/DT cells/NN crystallize/NN and/CC puncture/NN holes/NN in/IN the/DT cell/JJ walls/NN such/NN that/WDT when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP defrosted/JJ ,/, the/DT water/NN in/IN the/DT cells/JJ leak/NN out/IN and/CC you/PRP have/VBP a/DT piece/NN of/IN dry/JJ meat/NN ./. Fish/NN which/WDT has/VBZ not/RB been/VB frozen/JJ and/CC thawed/RB properly/RB turn/VB mushy/NN instead/RB ./. In/IN order/NN to/TO avoid/VB this/DT ,/, meats/NNS have/VBN to/TO be/VB blast/NN frozen/JJ so/IN that/WDT the/DT water/NN does/VBZ not/RB have/VB time/NN to/TO crystallize/VB ./. At/IN sea/NN ,/, they/PRP would/MD decapitate/VB the/DT tuna/NN and/CC throw/VB them/PRP into/IN a/DT bed/VB of/IN snow/NN and/CC apply/NN liquid/NN nitrogen/NN to/TO quickly/RB blast/NN freeze/IN the/DT fish/NN ./. Fish/NN frozen/JJ this/DT way/NN can/MD be/VB kept/NN for/IN 2/CD years/NNS and/CC when/WRB thawed/PRP is/VBZ supposed/JJ to/TO be/VB very/RB close/JJ to/TO fresh/VB fish/NN ./. So/RB ,/, when/WRB the/DT restaurant/NN declares/NN that/IN their/PRP$ fish/NN are/VBZ flown/RB fresh/JJ from/IN Tsukiji/NNP or/CC Hokkaido/NNP what/WP does/VBZ it/PRP mean/VB ?/. It/PRP certainly/RB does/VBD not/RB mean/VB that/IN the/DT fish/NN has/VBZ not/RB been/VB frozen/JJ ./. Perhaps/RB the/DT Hamachi/JJ -LRB-/NN yellowtail/NN -RRB-/NN is/VBZ fresh/JJ since/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT farmed/JJ fish/NN in/IN Japan/NNP and/CC it/PRP can/MD be/VB shipped/JJ directly/NN ./. Some/DT of/IN the/DT other/JJ fish/NN like/IN Saba/NNP -LRB-/NNP Mackeral/NNP -RRB-/NNP and/CC Kohada/NNP -LRB-/NNP Gizzard/NNP Shard/NNP -RRB-/NNP might/VBD also/RB be/VB fresh/JJ ,/, but/CC when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO Tuna/NNP ,/, it/PRP would/MD still/RB be/VB likely/NN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD frozen/JJ on/IN board/VBG the/DT ship/NN ./. Fukuichi/DT restaurant/NN stands/VBZ out/IN from/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN other/JJ Sushi/NN restaurants/NN in/IN how/WRB they/PRP source/VBP their/PRP$ fish/NN ./. Instead/JJ of/IN flying/VBG in/IN the/DT fish/NN fresh/JJ ,/, they/PRP tell/VBP you/PRP straight/VB off/IN that/WDT their/PRP$ tuna/NN and/CC swordfish/NN is/VBZ all/RB frozen/JJ and/CC fresh/JJ off/IN the/DT fishing/NN boats/NN ./. The/DT story/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT parent/NN company/NN is/VBZ involved/RB in/IN processing/JJ fish/NN ,/, freezing/RB them/PRP and/CC exporting/VB them/PRP to/TO Japan/NNP ./. Singapore/NNP ,/, being/VBG a/DT trans-shipment/JJ hub/NN is/VBZ an/DT ideal/JJ place/NN for/IN fishing/NN boats/NN to/TO off/IN load/IN their/PRP$ tuna/NN to/TO be/VB processed/NN into/IN sushi/JJ blocks/NN before/IN exporting/NN to/TO the/DT Japanese/JJ market/NN ./. So/CC the/DT owners/NNS thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ idea/NN to/TO make/VB some/NN of/IN these/DT fish/JJ available/JJ to/TO the/DT local/JJ market/NN and/CC tied/NN up/NN with/IN a/DT 100/CD year/NN old/JJ restaurant/NN chain/NN from/IN Japan/NNP to/TO set/NN up/IN Fukuichi/NN ./. I/PRP am/VBP pretty/RB weary/JJ about/IN eating/VBG cheap/JJ sushi/NN ,/, but/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN I/PRP am/VBD also/RB weary/JJ about/IN having/VBG to/TO pay/VB over/IN $/$ 100/CD to/TO sit/VB at/IN the/DT Sushi/NN bar/NN to/TO enjoy/VB a/DT Sushi/NN course/NN ./. So/NNP Fukuichi/NNP seems/VBZ to/TO fill/VB the/DT gap/NN in/IN between/IN by/IN providing/RB good/JJ quality/NN fish/NN at/IN a/DT more/JJ affordable/JJ price/NN ./. Just/JJ for/IN comparison/NN ,/, their/PRP$ Toro/NN is/VBZ $/$ 11/CD per/NN piece/NN and/CC Ama-ebi/NN is/VBZ $/$ 3/CD ./. I/PRP tried/VBD their/PRP$ sashimi/NN set/NN and/CC the/DT fish/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ even/RB though/IN they/PRP were/VBD frozen/JJ fish/NN ./. Then/RB again/RB ,/, most/NN of/IN these/DT fish/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN frozen/JJ even/NN at/IN your/PRP$ high/JJ end/NN restaurants/NN ./. A/DT few/JJ years/NNS back/RB ,/, I/PRP baulked/VBD at/IN the/DT thought/NN of/IN eating/VBG raw/JJ fish/NN ./. But/CC now/RB I/PRP love/VBP sushi/VBG ./. I/PRP was/VBD converted/JJ when/WRB I/PRP started/VBD my/PRP$ research/NN into/IN sushi/NN and/CC was/VBD taught/RB by/IN the/DT Sushi/NN Sage/NN ,/, Nogawa-San/NN ,/, how/RB to/TO enjoy/VB sushi/NN ./. -LRB-/JJ Check/NN out/IN my/PRP$ video/NN on/IN how/RB to/TO eat/VB Sushi/NN in/IN the/DT post/JJ -RRB-/NN Up/NN till/NN then/RB my/PRP$ experience/NN with/IN sushi/NN has/VBZ been/VBN limited/JJ to/TO conveyor/VB belt/NN sushi/NN ./. But/CC when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD converted/JJ when/WRB I/PRP learned/VBD the/DT pleasure/NN of/IN eating/NN sushi/NN at/IN the/DT bar/NN ./. Here/RB you/PRP can/MD interact/VB with/IN the/DT sushi/NN chef/NN and/CC learn/VBD a/DT lot/NN about/IN the/DT seafood/NN you/PRP are/VBP eating/VBG ./. The/DT cooked/VBN food/NN at/IN Fukuichi/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ too/RB ./. Chef/NNP John/NNP -LRB-/NNP previously/NNP from/IN Shimizu/NNP at/IN Gillman/NN and/CC Shinobu/NN at/IN the/DT PSA/JJ bldg/NN -RRB-/NN ,/, who/WP is/VBZ a/DT veteran/NN with/IN 25/CD years/NNS cooking/JJ Japanese/NN food/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP is/VBZ very/RB competent/VBN in/IN tweaking/NNP Japanese/NNP food/NN to/TO our/PRP$ local/JJ palate/NN while/NN still/RB preserving/VBD the/DT Japanese/NN character/NN of/IN each/JJ dish/NN ./. The/DT Kani/NN Tofu/NN starter/NN is/VBZ one/CD good/JJ example/NN ./. He/PRP marries/VBZ cold/JJ tofu/NN with/IN crab/NN meat/NN and/CC dresses/VB it/PRP with/IN a/DT sauce/NN made/VBD from/IN Century/NN Egg/NN and/CC Mirin/NN ./. This/DT makes/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ refreshing/VBG starter/NN which/WDT I/PRP quite/RB enjoy/VB ./. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD Since/IN Fukuichi/JJ specializes/NN in/IN tuna/NN and/CC swordfish/NN ,/, any/RB of/IN their/PRP$ dishes/NNS here/RB that/RB features/IN these/DT two/CD fish/NN are/VBP very/RB good/JJ value/NN ./. For/IN those/RB who/WP like/IN Otoro/NN ,/, you/PRP should/MD really/RB try/VB the/DT Kama/JJ Toro/NN or/CC Tuna/NNP collar/NNP ./. This/DT dish/NN comes/VBZ as/IN a/DT set/NN since/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN meat/NN available/JJ for/IN sushi/NN comprise/NN only/RB a/DT small/JJ portion/NN of/IN the/DT tuna/NN ./. So/RB when/WRB you/PRP order/VB Kama/VB Toro/RB ,/, they/PRP extract/VBD some/JJ bits/NNS for/IN nigiri/NN sushi/NN and/CC the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT collar/NN is/VBZ grilled/VBN and/CC served/VBD plain/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ dish/NN for/IN two/CD as/IN there/RB is/VBZ quite/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN meat/NN in/IN the/DT collar/NN which/WDT is/VBZ flavourful/JJ and/CC quite/RB fatty/JJ since/IN it/PRP is/VBZ from/IN the/DT portion/NN of/IN the/DT fish/NN just/RB in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT part/NN they/PRP carve/VB out/VB for/IN Otoro/NN ./. Swordfish/DT -LRB-/JJ mekajiki/NN -RRB-/NN is/VBZ very/RB nice/JJ for/IN sushi/NN as/IN it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT creamy/JJ ,/, buttery/JJ texture/NN ./. But/CC the/DT belly/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ too/RB soft/JJ to/TO be/VB served/VBD as/IN sushi/NN ,/, so/IN they/PRP serve/VBP it/PRP as/IN a/DT grilled/VBN set/NN which/WDT comprise/NN of/IN teriyaki/NN ,/, mentaiko/NN mayonnaise/NN and/CC miso/NN flavored/NN skewers/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ very/RB nice/JJ to/TO go/VB with/IN sake/NN as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB rich/JJ and/CC you/PRP really/RB ca/MD n't/RB go/VB wrong/JJ with/IN the/DT familiar/JJ flavors/NNS ./. 4.25/DT \//JJ 5/CD The/DT one/CD item/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP to/TO go/VB back/RB to/TO eat/VB is/VBZ Gindara/JJ Saikyo-yaki/NN which/WDT is/VBZ Gindara/RB marinated/VBD in/IN Saikyo/NN miso/NN ,/, mirin/NN and/CC sake/NN ./. Now/JJ ,/, I/PRP am/VBP very/RB partial/JJ to/TO Gindara/VB Teriyaki/NNP and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT dish/NN I/PRP order/VB all/DT the/DT time/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD very/RB very/RB pleasantly/RB surprised/VBD by/IN Chef/NN John/NNP 's/POS Gindara/NN Saikyo-yaki/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD easily/RB the/DT best/JJS I/PRP have/VBP tasted/VBN ./. Granted/DT it/PRP is/VBZ different/JJ from/IN Gindara/NNP Teriyaki/NNP ,/, but/CC from/IN now/RB on/IN it/PRP has/VBZ become/VBN my/PRP$ benchmark/NN for/IN any/DT Gindara/JJ dish/NN ./. For/IN $/$ 16/CD ,/, the/DT portion/NN is/VBZ generous/JJ and/CC if/IN you/PRP love/VBP Gindara/JJ ,/, you/PRP will/MD love/VB this/DT !/. There/EX is/VBZ no/RB sauce/NN in/IN this/DT dish/NN ,/, unlike/NNP Gindara/NNP Teriyaki/NNP ,/, but/CC the/DT marinade/NN has/VBZ seeped/VBN into/IN the/DT connective/JJ tissue/NN between/IN the/DT muscle/NN sheets/NNS ,/, so/RB you/PRP get/VB a/DT wonderful/JJ flavor/NN that/WDT hits/VBZ the/DT back/RB of/IN the/DT palate/NN when/WRB you/PRP start/VB chewing/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG to/TO have/VB one/CD dish/NN that/WDT will/MD help/VB you/PRP finish/VB a/DT whole/JJ bowl/NN of/IN rice/NN ,/, then/RB you/PRP might/VB like/VB to/TO try/VB the/DT Ebi/JJ Teppan/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ of/IN course/NN a/DT very/RB familiar/JJ dish/NN but/CC I/PRP like/VB how/WRB Chef/NNP John/NNP managed/VBD to/TO infuse/VB a/DT nice/JJ charred/NN flavor/NN to/TO the/DT prawns/NNS by/IN dicing/VBG it/PRP and/CC pan/VBD frying/VBG it/PRP over/IN a/DT hot/JJ plate/NN instead/RB of/IN the/DT more/JJ common/JJ way/NN of/IN butterflying/VBG the/DT prawns/NNS and/CC grilling/VB it/PRP ./. The/DT flesh/NN of/IN the/DT King/NNP Prawns/NNP is/VBZ nice/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ and/CC you/PRP may/MD be/VB tempted/VBD to/TO order/VB another/DT bowl/NN of/IN rice/NN to/TO go/VB with/IN it/PRP ./. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD For/IN those/RB looking/VBG for/IN Yu/NNP Sheng/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ different/JJ ,/, you/PRP can/MD try/VB the/DT Yu/NNP Sheng/NNP at/IN Fukuichi/NNP ./. All/PDT the/DT dried/JJ pickles/NN and/CC ingredients/NNS are/VBP made/VBD in/IN house/NN and/CC they/PRP use/VB Salmon/NN ,/, swordfish/NN and/CC octopus/NN for/IN the/DT raw/JJ fish/NN ./. The/DT sets/NNS are/VBP $/$ 38/CD +/NN +/NN nett/NN -LRB-/NN salmon/NN only/RB -RRB-/NN and/CC $/$ 68/CD +/NNP +/NNP nett/NNP -LRB-/NNP Salmon/NN ,/, Octopus/NN and/CC Swordfish/NN -RRB-/NN ./. We/PRP recently/RB held/VBD our/PRP$ Canon-ieat/JJ photography/NN workshop/NN at/IN Fukuichi/NN and/CC our/JJ participants/NN were/VBD treated/RB to/TO some/DT excellent/JJ arrangements/NN by/IN Chef/NN John/NN ./. I/PRP shall/VB leave/VB it/PRP to/TO you/PRP to/TO admire/VB the/DT photos/NNS courtesy/RB of/IN Joao/NN who/WP attended/VBZ my/PRP$ class/NN last/JJ year/NN ./. Thanks/JJ for/IN the/DT photos/NNS Joao/RB !/. Conclusion/NN If/IN you/PRP enjoy/VB Japanese/NN food/NN with/IN the/DT family/NN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ place/NN to/TO check/VB out/IN ./. Prices/NNS are/VBP reasonable/JJ and/CC the/DT quality/NN of/IN sushi/NN is/VBZ much/RB better/JJR than/IN the/DT usual/JJ chains/NN at/IN the/DT shopping/VBG centres/NN ./. So/CC you/PRP probably/RB end/VB up/IN paying/NN just/RB a/DT little/JJ more/JJ but/CC you/PRP get/VB much/JJ better/NN ingredients/NNS ./. The/DT restaurant/NN owns/IN the/DT processing/JJ plant/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP and/CC so/RB the/DT items/NNS which/WDT feature/NN tuna/NN and/CC swordfish/NNS are/VBP really/RB great/JJ value/NN ./.
