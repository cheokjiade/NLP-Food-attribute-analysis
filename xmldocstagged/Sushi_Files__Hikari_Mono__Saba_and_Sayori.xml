<title>Sushi Files: Hikari Mono: Saba and Sayori</title>
<text>The/DT Fish/NN Saba/NN is/VBZ a/DT favorite/JJ fish/NN amongst/NN the/DT Japanese/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ served/VBD in/IN sushi/NN ,/, grilled/VBN ,/, stewed/VBD and/CC even/RB canned/NN ./. Like/JJ Sardine/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT plentiful/JJ fish/NN that/WDT is/VBZ found/VBN in/IN the/DT waters/NN of/IN Japan/NNP ./. It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT fish/NN that/WDT is/VBZ rich/JJ in/IN oils/NN and/CC very/RB flavourful/JJ ./. However/RB ,/, this/DT oiliness/NN is/VBZ also/RB its/PRP$ drawback/JJ as/IN it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB keep/VB very/RB well/RB ./. So/RB in/IN the/DT good/JJ old/JJ days/NNS ,/, Saba/NN is/VBZ often/JJ cured/NN and/CC the/DT only/JJ people/NN fortunate/IN enough/JJ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO eat/VB fresh/JJ Saba/NN as/IN sashimi/NNS are/VBP the/DT fishermen/NN themselves/NN ./. Nowadays/RB ,/, modern/NN refrigeration/NN has/VBZ made/VBD it/PRP also/RB possible/JJ for/IN us/PRP$ to/TO eat/VB fresh/JJ Saba/NN ,/, although/RB it/PRP should/MD still/VB be/VB eaten/VBD very/RB fresh/JJ or/CC it/PRP would/MD cause/VB Scombroid/JJ poisoning/NN ./. Scombroid/JJ poisoning/NN can/MD occur/VB in/IN all/DT the/DT fishes/NN in/IN the/DT family/NN Scombroidae/NN ,/, which/WDT include/JJ fish/NN like/IN Mackerals/NNP ,/, Mahi/NNP Mahi/NNP and/CC Tuna/NNP ./. When/WRB Saba/NN is/VBZ caught/VBN ,/, its/PRP$ digestive/JJ enzymes/NNS start/VB to/TO breakdown/VB histadine/RB in/IN its/PRP$ flesh/NN into/IN histamine/NN ,/, especially/RB when/WRB the/DT fish/NN is/VBZ not/RB kept/JJ on/IN ice/NN ./. You/PRP all/RB will/VB be/VB very/RB familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT effects/NN of/IN histamines/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ compound/NN that/WDT causes/VBZ the/DT typical/JJ allergic/NN reaction/NN of/IN rash/NN and/CC runny/NN nose/NN which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB anti-histamines/NNS are/VBP prescribed/JJ for/IN these/DT conditions/NN ./. In/IN the/DT same/JJ way/NN ,/, Scombroid/NN poisoning/NN can/MD also/RB make/VB it/PRP look/VB as/IN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP allergic/JJ to/TO Saba/VB ./. However/RB ,/, unlike/RB an/DT allergy/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD take/VB Saba/RB again/RB as/IN long/JJ as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ fresh/JJ ./. In/IN Singapore/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP more/JJ familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT Spanish/JJ Mackeral/NN which/WDT is/VBZ known/VBN locally/NN as/IN Tengiri/NN or/CC Batang/NN ./. These/DT are/VBP close/JJ cousins/NN of/IN the/DT Saba/NN but/CC will/MD not/RB make/VB very/RB good/JJ Sushi/NN ./. In/IN Japan/NNP they/PRP are/VBP known/VBN as/IN Sawara/NN ./. They/PRP are/VBP a/DT much/JJ larger/NN fish/NN and/CC can/MD be/VB caught/VBN in/IN local/NNP waters/NNP whereas/IN the/DT Saba/NN is/VBZ found/JJ only/RB in/IN the/DT cooler/JJ waters/NN up/IN North/NN ./. Name/NNP :/: Saba/NNP ,/, Chub/NNP Mackeral/NNP ,/, Scomber/NNP Japonicus/NNP Seasonality/NNP :/: Autumn/NNP Size/NNP :/: 30/CD to/TO 50/CD inches/. The/DT Tane/NN If/IN you/PRP are/VBP averse/JJ to/TO fishy/JJ fish/NN ,/, then/RB you/PRP really/RB need/VB to/TO take/VB Saba/RB when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ absolutely/RB fresh/JJ ./. In/IN Singapore/NN ,/, most/NN Saba/NN that/WDT is/VBZ used/VBD for/IN Sushi/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN cured/JJ ./. The/DT flesh/NN is/VBZ oily/JJ and/CC meaty/JJ and/CC this/DT has/VBZ a/DT lot/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN the/DT aforementioned/JJ histadine/NN which/WDT is/VBZ responsible/JJ for/IN what/WP the/DT Japanese/NN describe/VB as/IN ``/JJ Kokumi/NN ''/NN or/CC heartiness/NN ./. Kokumi/DT is/VBZ the/DT latest/JJS taste/NN sense/NN that/IN the/DT Japanese/NN scientists/NN from/IN Ajinomoto/NNS are/VBP now/RB proposing/JJ ./. We/PRP all/RB know/VB Umami/NN is/VBZ that/RB savoury/JJ flavor/NN you/PRP find/VB in/IN a/DT good/JJ meat/NN broth/NN ,/, but/CC on/IN top/JJ of/IN just/RB being/VBG savoury/NN there/RB is/VBZ that/RB feeling/VBG of/IN full/JJ bodiness/NN that/WDT comes/VBZ from/IN eating/NN ,/, say/VB a/DT good/JJ Laksa/NN or/CC Lagsane/NN ./. That/DT is/VBZ Kokumi/RB ,/, and/CC fish/NN like/IN Saba/NNP and/CC Tuna/NNP are/VBP full/JJ of/IN histadine/NN and/CC thus/RB full/JJ of/IN Kokumi/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ one/CD tane/NN that/IN you/PRP can/MD easily/RB identify/VB from/IN the/DT wavy/JJ black/NN lines/NN on/IN a/DT background/NN of/IN silvery/NN blue/JJ skin/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ usually/RB served/VBD with/IN either/NN some/NN grated/NN ginger/NN and/CC shallots/NN or/CC topped/VBD with/IN some/JJ seaweed/NN ./. Fishiness/JJ scale/NN :/: 4-5\/5/. The/DT Fish/NN It/PRP seems/VBZ that/IN no/RB one/CD really/RB eats/VB this/DT fish/NN except/IN the/DT Japanese/NN who/WP prize/VBZ it/PRP as/IN a/DT sushi/JJ tane/NN ./. Much/DT of/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN use/VB this/DT fish/NN as/IN bait/NN for/IN much/JJ larger/NN fish/NN like/IN Tuna/NNP and/CC Mackeral/NNP ./. They/PRP are/VBP easily/RB recognizable/JJ as/IN a/DT long/JJ and/CC slender/JJ fish/NN with/IN a/DT lower/JJR jaw/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ much/RB longer/RB then/RB the/DT upper/JJ jaw/NN ./. This/DT helps/VBZ it/PRP to/TO feed/VB on/IN the/DT water/NN surface/NN ./. When/WRB frightened/NN ,/, the/DT Sayori/NN can/MD literally/VB fly/VB out/VB of/IN the/DT water/NN much/RB like/IN the/DT flying/VBG fish/NN -LRB-/NN but/CC not/RB as/IN far/JJ -RRB-/NN to/TO escape/VB the/DT predator/NN ./. Name/NNP :/: Sayori/NNP ,/, Halfbeak/NNP ,/, Hyporhamphus/NNP sajori/NNP Seasonlity/NNP :/: Spring/NNP and/CC Summer/NNP Size/NNP :/: 1/CD foot/. The/DT Tane/NN Of/IN all/DT the/DT Hikari/NN Mono/NN ,/, Sayori/NN is/VBZ the/DT least/RB fishy/JJ and/CC so/RB it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ one/CD to/TO start/VB with/IN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP aversed/JJ to/TO fishy/JJ fish/NN ./. The/DT flesh/NN is/VBZ very/RB delicate/JJ and/CC the/DT flavor/NN can/MD be/VB enhanced/VBD with/IN a/DT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN ginger/NN which/WDT is/VBZ sometimes/RB served/VBD with/IN it/PRP ./. As/IN the/DT fish/NN is/VBZ very/RB slim/JJ ,/, sometimes/RB the/DT itamae/NN will/MD choose/VB to/TO cut/VB it/PRP into/IN little/JJ strips/NN and/CC braid/VB it/PRP on/IN top/NN of/IN the/DT sushi/NN ./. This/DT would/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ Hikari/NN Mono/NN to/TO start/VB with/IN as/IN the/DT fishiness/NN scale/NN is/VBZ only/RB 2\/5/JJ ./. Acknowledgement/.
