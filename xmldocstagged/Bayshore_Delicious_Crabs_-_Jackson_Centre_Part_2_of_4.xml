<title>Bayshore Delicious Crabs - Jackson Centre Part 2 of 4</title>
<text>I/PRP did/VBD not/RB actually/RB plan/VBD to/TO eat/VB crab/NN today/NN ./. I/PRP mean/VB ,/, crabs/NN are/VBP not/RB your/JJ typical/NN lunch/NN item/NN ./. But/CC after/IN shooting/JJ pictures/NN at/IN the/DT Ngo/JJ Hiang/NN place/NN ,/, I/PRP walked/VBD past/IN this/DT store/NN with/IN a/DT big/JJ cage/JJ full/JJ of/IN crabs/NN and/CC spied/VB a/DT familiar/JJ looking/VBG face/NN ./. ``/WP Hey/UH ,/, Uncle/NN !/. Are/DT n't/RB you/PRP a/DT TV/JJ star/NN ?/. ''/CC It/PRP was/VBD none/JJ other/JJ then/RB Tang/JJ Hu/NN ,/, the/DT veteran/NN actor/NN who/WP started/VBD in/IN the/DT good/JJ old/JJ days/NNS of/IN Black/JJ and/CC White/JJ TV/NN with/IN Wang/NN Sa/NN and/CC Ye/NNP Fong/NNP ./. What/WP was/VBD he/PRP doing/VBG here/RB ?/. Well/RB ,/, it/PRP turns/VBZ out/IN that/WDT this/DT is/VBZ his/PRP$ semi/JJ retirement/NN business/NN ./. He/PRP started/VBD this/DT stall/NN 6/CD years/NNS ago/RB after/IN insistence/NN from/IN his/PRP$ friends/NNS that/IN his/PRP$ wife/NN 's/POS crabs/NN were/VBD shiok/NN shiok/NN ./. Seeing/DT that/WDT I/PRP was/VBD enthusiastically/JJ shooting/NN pictures/NN of/IN his/PRP$ crabs/NN ,/, he/PRP gladly/VBZ got/VBN up/RP to/TO teach/VB me/PRP a/DT few/JJ tips/NNS on/IN picking/VBG the/DT perfect/JJ crab/NN ./. First/DT of/IN all/DT there/EX are/VBP a/DT few/JJ types/NN that/WDT are/VBP commonly/JJ available/JJ in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. The/DT ones/NNS from/IN India/NN and/CC Sri/NN Lanka/NN usually/RB have/VBN this/DT type/NN of/IN twine/NN binding/IN their/PRP$ claws/NN as/IN oppose/JJ to/TO nylon/VB ones/NNS for/IN the/DT Indonesian/NN Crabs/NNS ./. You/PRP will/MD also/RB notice/VB the/DT difference/NN in/IN color/NN between/IN Sri/NN Lankan/NN and/CC Indian/NN crabs/NN ./. So/RB how/RB do/VB you/PRP pick/VB a/DT good/JJ crab/NN ?/. First/JJ ,/, Uncle/NN Hu/NN tells/VBZ me/PRP ,/, is/VBZ to/TO make/VB sure/VB that/WDT the/DT crabs/NN are/VBP heavy/JJ ./. I/PRP guess/VBP you/PRP can/MD only/RB tell/VB after/IN handling/VBG a/DT few/JJ heavy/NNS and/CC light/JJ crabs/NN ./. Secondly/JJ ,/, you/PRP pull/VB on/IN the/DT back/RB legs/NNS and/CC the/DT tone/NN should/MD be/VB good/JJ ie/IN the/DT crab/NN pulls/VBZ his/PRP$ legs/NNS strongly/RB away/RB from/IN your/PRP$ finger/NN ./. You/PRP then/RB decide/VBD if/IN you/PRP want/VB a/DT Man/JJ crab/NN or/CC a/DT Woman/JJ crab/NN ./. Do/VBP n't/RB make/VB the/DT mistake/NN of/IN picking/VBG a/DT Woman/JJ crab/NN if/IN you/PRP plan/VB on/IN ordering/VBG pepper/NN or/CC chilli/NN crab/NN ./. All/PDT that/WDT roe/NN is/VBZ lost/JJ and/CC wasted/VBD in/IN the/DT frying/VBG process/NN ./. -LRB-/. This/DT is/VBZ a/DT Teochew/NNP Ah/NN Hia/NN 's/POS point/NN of/IN view/VB OK/NN ?/. -RRB-/CC Woman/JJ crabs/NN should/MD be/VB simply/RB steamed/VBN so/RB that/IN you/PRP can/MD appreciate/VB all/DT that/WDT roe/NN ./. Unlike/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN big/JJ seafood/NN places/NNS ,/, the/DT crabs/NN here/RB are/VBP killed/VBN on/IN the/DT spot/NN and/CC fried/VBD to/TO order/VB ./. -LRB-/WP I/PRP have/VBP always/RB suspected/VB that/IN the/DT big/JJ seafood/NN places/NNS steam/IN their/PRP$ crabs/NN first/JJ then/RB throw/VB the/DT prepared/VBD chilli/NN sauce/NN over/IN the/DT crabs/NN before/IN serving/VBG -/: if/IN someone/NN knows/NN for/IN sure/JJ please/NN let/VB us/PRP know/VB -RRB-/VB Here/RB ,/, everything/NN is/VBZ prepared/VBD when/WRB you/PRP order/VB ./. The/DT picture/NN above/NN shows/IN the/DT crab/NN simmering/NN in/IN the/DT white/JJ pepper/NN sauce/NN ./. This/DT will/MD simmer/VB for/IN 5/CD minutes/NN till/IN the/DT sauce/NN thickens/NN then/RB served/VBD ./. This/DT way/NN the/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ infused/JJ with/IN the/DT sweet/JJ goodness/NN of/IN the/DT crab/NN ./. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB usually/RB like/IN food/NN that/WDT is/VBZ too/RB spicy/JJ ,/, so/IN I/PRP found/VBD their/PRP$ chilli/NN sauce/NN just/RB nice/JJ ./. Its/PRP also/RB a/DT bit/NN sweeter/NN ,/, just/RB the/DT way/NN I/PRP like/VB it/PRP ./. Great/JJ with/IN mantou/NN ./. You/PRP can/MD see/VB from/IN the/DT picture/NN that/IN the/DT crab/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB solid/JJ ./. The/DT white/JJ pepper/NN sauce/NN was/VBD nice/JJ but/CC not/RB overpowering/VB such/NN that/IN you/PRP can/MD still/RB taste/VB the/DT sweetness/NN of/IN the/DT flesh/NN ./. But/CC having/VBG also/RB tasted/VBD the/DT famous/JJ White/NNP Pepper/NNP Crab/NNP from/IN No/JJ Signboard/NNS before/IN ,/, I/PRP have/VB decided/VBD that/WDT maybe/RB I/PRP just/RB do/VBP n't/RB like/VB the/DT White/JJ Pepper/NN Crabs/NNS as/IN much/JJ as/IN Black/JJ Pepper/NN Crabs/NNS ./. Conclusion/NN Very/RB good/JJ and/CC solid/JJ crabs/NN ./. Did/JJ n't/RB quite/RB enjoy/VB the/DT White/JJ Pepper/NN version/NN but/CC I/PRP would/MD go/VB back/RB and/CC try/VB the/DT Black/JJ Pepper/NN Crabs/NNS next/JJ time/NN ./. The/DT nicest/NNP Black/NNP Pepper/NNP Crab/NNP I/PRP had/VBD was/VBD in/IN Bangkok/NN ./. The/DT difference/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT crab/NN is/VBZ first/JJ coated/VBN with/IN Sweet/NNP Potato/NNP Flour/NN and/CC deep/VB fried/VBD before/IN it/PRP is/VBZ added/VBD to/TO the/DT sauce/NN and/CC simmered/NN ./. Wow/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP increases/RB the/DT calorie/NN count/NN immensely/NN ./.
