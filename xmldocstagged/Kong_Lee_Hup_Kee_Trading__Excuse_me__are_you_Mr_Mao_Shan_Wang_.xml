<title>Kong Lee Hup Kee Trading: Excuse me, are you Mr Mao Shan Wang?</title>
<text>When/WRB I/PRP was/VBD a/DT kid/NN ,/, Durian/NNP season/NNP was/VBD very/RB special/JJ and/CC we/PRP would/MD look/VB forward/VB to/TO it/PRP with/IN much/JJ anticipation/NN ./. Nowadays/RB ,/, it/PRP feels/VBZ as/IN if/IN you/PRP can/MD get/VB Durians/NNPS throughout/IN the/DT year/NN ./. That/DT is/VBZ made/VBD possible/JJ by/IN the/DT lengthening/NN of/IN the/DT Malaysian/JJ Durian/NNP Season/NNP as/IN well/RB as/IN the/DT importation/NN of/IN Durians/NNPS from/IN other/JJ countries/NN such/NN as/IN Thailand/NN ./. The/DT main/JJ season/NN for/IN Malaysian/JJ Durians/NNPS starts/NNS from/IN May/NN and/CC lasts/NN until/IN August/NN with/IN another/DT season/NN from/IN mid/NNP October/NNP till/NN December/NN ./. The/DT fruit/NN takes/NN around/IN 120/NN to/TO 140/VB days/NNS to/TO develop/VB ./. So/CC right/RB now/RB we/PRP are/VBP at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT mid/JJ year/NN season/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT Durian/NNP trees/NNS are/VBP already/RB starting/VBG to/TO flower/VB and/CC news/NN from/IN the/DT plantations/NN is/VBZ that/WDT we/PRP should/VB be/VB expecting/VBG a/DT bumper/JJ crop/NN in/IN October/NN if/IN all/DT goes/VBZ well/RB as/IN there/RB are/VBP many/JJ flowers/NNS on/IN the/DT trees/NN !/. So/RB what/WP do/VBP you/PRP do/VB if/IN you/PRP have/VBP a/DT serious/JJ Durian/NNP craving/NN in/IN between/IN seasons/NN ?/. Well/RB ,/, you/PRP can/MD still/RB get/VB Thai/PRP Durians/NNPS and/CC the/DT one/CD they/PRP often/JJ import/NN is/VBZ the/DT D123/JJ Chanee/NN ./. The/DT fruit/NN is/VBZ can/MD sometimes/RB be/VB mistaken/JJ as/IN a/DT Mao/JJ Shan/NN Wang/NN because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ thick/JJ yellow/NN flesh/NN and/CC indeed/RB it/PRP is/VBZ sometimes/RB sold/VBN at/IN Mao/NN Shan/NN Wang/NN prices/NN ./. But/CC do/VB not/RB be/VB mistaken/JJ ./. It/PRP usually/RB costs/VBZ only/RB around/IN $/$ 5/CD -/: $/$ 6\/kg/CD and/CC for/IN that/WDT price/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ n't/RB a/DT bad/JJ alternative/NN ./. But/CC you/PRP should/VB not/RB be/VB paying/NN $/$ 25\/kg/CD for/IN such/JJ a/DT Durian/NNP thinking/VBG that/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT Mao/JJ Shan/NN Wang/NN ./. The/DT Chanee/NN is/VBZ usually/RB a/DT large/JJ sized/VBN fruit/NN with/IN greyish/JJ green/JJ husk/NN ,/, and/CC thick/JJ thorns/NN with/IN brownish/NN tips/NN ./. The/DT flesh/NN is/VBZ golden/RB yellow/JJ ,/, thick/JJ and/CC creamy/JJ and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT strong/JJ aroma/NN ./. However/RB ,/, compared/VBD to/TO a/DT Mao/JJ Shan/NN Wang/NN ,/, the/DT flavor/NN is/VBZ much/RB less/JJ complex/NN and/CC it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB that/IN bitterness/JJ to/TO balance/VB out/IN the/DT sweetness/NN ./. Mr/NNP Chia/NNP at/IN Kong/NNP Lee/NNP Hup/NNP Kee/NNP would/MD occasionally/VB get/VB the/DT odd/JJ D123/NN from/IN his/PRP$ supplier/NN as/IN part/NN of/IN a/DT basket/NN of/IN miscellaneous/NN Durians/NNPS from/IN the/DT plantation/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD fortunate/JJ that/CC he/PRP had/VBD one/CD for/IN the/DT photoshoot/NN that/IN day/NN ./. However/RB ,/, he/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB usually/RB sell/VB the/DT D123/NN since/IN he/PRP closes/VBZ his/PRP$ shop/NN in/IN between/IN seasons/NN ./. Conclusion/NN This/DT is/VBZ just/RB a/DT post/NN to/TO compare/VB the/DT D123/JJ Chanee/NN with/IN the/DT D197/JJ Mao/NN Shan/NN Wang/NN since/IN the/DT it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB commonly/JJ seen/NN in/IN between/IN the/DT main/JJ Durian/NNP Seasons/NNP ./. It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT bad/JJ fruit/NN to/TO eat/VB but/CC the/DT flavor/NN can/MD not/RB match/VB that/IN of/IN a/DT D197/JJ Mao/NN Shan/NN Wang/NN and/CC you/PRP should/VB not/RB be/VB paying/NN top/JJ dollar/NN for/IN it/PRP ./.
