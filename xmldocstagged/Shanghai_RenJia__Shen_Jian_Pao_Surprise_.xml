<title>Shanghai RenJia: Shen Jian Pao Surprise!</title>
<text>I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB remember/VB ever/RB eating/VBG Xiao/NNP Long/NNP Bao/NNP -LRB-/NNP XLB/NNP -RRB-/NNP when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD a/DT kid/NN ./. I/PRP think/VB it/PRP is/VBZ something/NN that/WDT has/VBZ taken/VBN Singapore/NN by/IN storm/NN in/IN the/DT last/JJ decade/NN ./. The/DT beauty/NN of/IN the/DT XLB/NN is/VBZ the/DT spoonful/NN of/IN soup/NN that/WDT you/PRP get/VB in/IN each/JJ dumpling/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBP always/RB wondered/VBN how/WRB they/PRP managed/VBD to/TO get/VB the/DT soup/NN in/IN the/DT dumpling/NN ./. Was/DT it/PRP from/IN the/DT meat/NN or/CC do/VB they/PRP somehow/RB add/VB it/PRP in/IN ./. Well/IN it/PRP happens/VBZ that/WDT there/EX are/VBP many/JJ ways/NNS of/IN getting/VBG the/DT soup/NN in/IN the/DT dumpling/NN ./. The/DT shortcut/NN way/NN is/VBZ to/TO add/VB more/JJ oil/NN into/IN the/DT meat/NN filling/NN ./. This/DT would/MD make/VB the/DT dumpling/NN very/RB rich/JJ ./. The/DT proper/NN way/NN is/VBZ to/TO prepare/VB the/DT soup/NN before/IN hand/NN ,/, chill/VB it/PRP such/JJ that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT jelly/NN like/IN consistency/NN and/CC mix/VB it/PRP into/IN the/DT meat/NN filling/NN ./. The/DT soup/NN in/IN the/DT dumpling/NN is/VBZ thus/RB very/RB light/JJ and/CC tasty/JJ after/IN having/VBG extracted/IN the/DT flavors/NNS from/IN the/DT meat/NN filling/NN ./. Since/IN we/PRP were/VBD sitting/VBG in/IN a/DT restaurant/NN where/WRB the/DT hosts/NN were/VBD Shanghainese/RB ,/, I/PRP asked/VBD them/PRP what/WP the/DT proper/NN way/NN to/TO eat/VB XLB/RB was/VBD ./. There/EX are/VBP a/DT couple/NN of/IN ways/NN I/PRP could/MD think/VB of/IN ./. I/PRP used/VBD to/TO dip/VB the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN in/IN the/DT vinegar/NN ,/, put/VB a/DT few/JJ strands/NN of/IN ginger/NN on/IN top/NN and/CC put/VB the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN in/IN my/PRP$ mouth/NN ./. This/DT way/NN ,/, the/DT dumpling/NN bursts/NNS like/IN a/DT balloon/NN in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN releasing/IN all/DT that/WDT wonderful/JJ soup/NN and/CC meaty/JJ flavors/NNS ./. -LRB-/RB Have/VB to/TO make/VB sure/VB its/PRP$ not/RB too/RB hot/JJ -RRB-/. The/DT Lao/NNP Ban/NNP Niang/NNP suggested/NNP that/WDT one/CD should/MD put/VB the/DT dumpling/NN in/IN the/DT soup/NN spoon/NN ,/, bite/VB a/DT little/JJ hole/NN and/CC suck/VB out/IN the/DT soup/NN first/JJ ,/, then/RB dip/VB the/DT dumpling/NN in/IN the/DT vinegar/NN and/CC eat/VB the/DT rest/NN ./. This/DT way/NN you/PRP get/VB to/TO savor/VB the/DT beautiful/NN soup/NN first/JJ ./. My/PRP$ son/JJ likes/NN to/TO break/VB the/DT whole/JJ dumpling/NNS open/VB in/IN the/DT bowl/NN ,/, eat/VB the/DT skin/NN first/JJ ,/, the/DT meat/NN second/NN and/CC drink/NN the/DT soup/NN from/IN the/DT bowl/NN last/JJ ./. -LRB-/JJ Talk/NN about/IN menu/NN deconstruction/NN !/. -RRB-/RB So/CC pray/PRP tell/VBP ,/, how/RB do/VB YOU/NN savor/IN your/PRP$ XLB/NN ?/. -LRB-/DT Tell/NN us/PRP by/IN taking/VBG part/NN in/IN the/DT latest/JJS poll/NN !/. -RRB-/RB The/DT XLB/NN here/RB is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ./. There/EX is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ amount/NN of/IN soup/NN in/IN each/JJ dumpling/NN and/CC the/DT skin/NN is/VBZ resilient/RB so/RB that/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB break/VB easily/RB ./. The/DT Lao/NN Ban/NN had/VBD been/VBN in/IN the/DT flour/NN business/IN all/DT his/PRP$ life/NN and/CC is/VBZ very/RB knowledgeable/JJ about/IN all/DT sorts/NN of/IN different/JJ flours/NN ./. So/CC the/DT skin/NN of/IN the/DT baos/NN here/RB are/VBP excellent/JJ ./. I/PRP felt/VBD though/IN that/IN it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN perfect/JJ if/IN the/DT skin/NN was/VBD a/DT fraction/NN thinner/NN and/CC the/DT filling/NN had/VBD more/NN ooomph/NN ./. Nonetheless/DT it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT XLB/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD rate/NN as/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. The/DT Shen/NNP Jian/NNP Pao/NNP -LRB-/NNP SJP/NNP -RRB-/NNP on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN is/VBZ an/DT item/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD drive/VB all/RB the/DT way/NN from/IN Siglap/NN to/TO eat/VB again/RB tomorrow/RB !/. This/DT is/VBZ seriously/RB a/DT delightful/JJ and/CC exciting/JJ discovery/NN ./. I/PRP would/MD even/RB go/VB so/RB far/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ most/JJ special/JJ Pao/NN one/CD can/MD ever/RB savor/VB ./. The/DT Pao/NN is/VBZ fried/VBD in/IN a/DT covered/JJ saucepan/NN ./. So/CC the/DT oil/NN cooks/IN the/DT bottom/NN half/NN of/IN the/DT Pao/JJ skin/NN so/RB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ crisp/JJ on/IN the/DT outside/NN ./. The/DT steam/NN trapped/NN in/IN the/DT saucepan/NN steams/IN the/DT top/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT Pao/NN to/TO a/DT nice/JJ fluffy/JJ consistency/NN ./. When/WRB you/PRP bite/VB into/IN the/DT Pao/NN ,/, the/DT juices/NNS just/RB flow/VB out/IN and/CC ,/, if/IN you/PRP are/VBP not/RB careful/JJ ,/, down/NN onto/IN your/PRP$ chin/NN !/. So/RB in/IN one/CD bite/VB ,/, you/PRP get/VB a/DT tender/NN meat/NN filling/NN ,/, an/DT explosion/NN of/IN juices/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ absorbed/RB by/IN the/DT soft/JJ skin/NN and/CC lastly/VBD a/DT crispy/NN caramelised/VBN skin/NN to/TO tease/VB your/PRP$ palate/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ such/JJ a/DT joy/NN to/TO eat/VB !/. I/PRP just/RB crave/VBD to/TO rave/VB ./. Crave/JJ to/TO rave/NN ,/, I/PRP say/VB !/. Best/NN SJP/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, JB/NNP and/CC maybe/RB even/RB Shanghai/VB !/. The/DT restaurant/NN serves/VBZ a/DT host/VB of/IN other/JJ Shanghainese/NN favorites/NNS like/IN drunken/JJ chicken/NN ,/, deep/JJ fried/VBD ribbon/NN fish/NN ,/, la/NN mian/NN and/CC so/RB on/IN ./. We/PRP were/VBD recommended/RB this/DT Shanghainese/JJ style/NN Ter/NN Kah/NN which/WDT is/VBZ excellent/JJ ./. Shanghainese/NNP Lor/NNP -LRB-/NNP Braising/NNP Sauce/NNP -RRB-/NN is/VBZ thick/JJ ,/, gooey/JJ and/CC sweet/JJ ./. The/DT meat/NN is/VBZ soft/JJ and/CC well/RB caramelized/RB ./. It/PRP is/VBZ different/JJ from/IN the/DT Teochew/NNP and/CC Hokkien/JJ style/NN that/WDT we/PRP are/VBP used/VBN to/TO but/CC shiok/JJ nonetheless/NN ./. The/DT lady/NN in/IN the/DT middle/JJ was/VBD introduced/VBD to/TO us/PRP as/IN the/DT Masterchef/NN who/WP taught/VBZ the/DT Masterchefs/NN in/IN Shanghai/NN ,/, before/IN she/PRP came/VBD to/TO Singapore/NNP ./. The/DT Lao/NN Ban/NN said/JJ that/WDT he/PRP was/VBD extremely/JJ fortunate/NN to/TO get/VB her/PRP to/TO work/VB in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./. Both/CC he/PRP and/CC his/PRP$ wife/NN lived/VBD in/IN Singapore/NNP for/IN almost/RB 15/CD years/NNS before/RB starting/VBG this/DT restaurant/NN out/IN of/IN a/DT love/RB to/TO share/VB their/PRP$ Shanghainese/NN food/NN with/IN Singaporeans/NNS ./. They/PRP were/VBD passionate/JJ about/IN their/PRP$ food/NN and/CC provided/VBD great/JJ service/NN as/IN well/RB ./.
