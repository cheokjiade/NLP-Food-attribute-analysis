<title>Grub: Big Breakfast in the Park!</title>
<text>Places/NNS like/IN Grub/NNS are/VBP really/RB hard/JJ to/TO come/VB by/IN in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP the/DT type/NN that/WDT imagine/VB the/DT perfect/JJ weekend/NN brunch/NN to/TO be/VB sitting/VBG in/IN the/DT park/NN enjoying/VBG sausage/NN ,/, eggs/NN ,/, pancakes/NN toast/NN with/IN your/PRP$ weekend/NN tablet/NN ,/, then/RB you/PRP would/MD know/VB that/WDT you/PRP either/VB have/VB to/TO pay/VB through/IN your/PRP$ nose/NN for/IN it/PRP or/CC end/NN up/NN in/IN McDonalds/NN at/IN Bishan/NNP Park/NNP or/CC Japanese/NNP Gardens/NNP ./. If/IN that/WDT is/VBZ you/PRP ,/, then/RB Grub/NN is/VBZ the/DT piece/NN of/IN good/JJ news/NN that/IN you/PRP have/VBP been/VBN waiting/VBG for/IN !/. Located/VBN in/IN Bishan/NN Park/NN ,/, Grub/NN is/VBZ a/DT solitary/JJ shack/NN in/IN the/DT midst/NN of/IN greenery/NN with/IN a/DT free/JJ public/NN car/NN park/NN just/RB a/DT short/NN walking/VBG distance/NN from/IN it/PRP ./. The/DT food/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ./. Not/RB just/RB well/RB executed/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC good/JJ as/IN in/IN they/PRP use/VBP responsible/JJ produce/NN which/WDT are/VBP sustainable/JJ ,/, healthier/JJ and/CC natural/JJ ./. On/JJ top/NN of/IN that/WDT ,/, most/NN of/IN their/PRP$ dishes/NNS are/VBP priced/VBD below/IN $/$ 12/CD which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT criteria/JJ imposed/NN by/IN National/NN Parks/NN so/RB that/CC it/PRP will/VB be/VB available/JJ to/TO the/DT masses/NN ./. Now/JJ ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB right/JJ in/IN saying/VBG that/WDT Grub/NN is/VBZ the/DT piece/NN of/IN good/JJ news/NN you/PRP are/VBP waiting/VBG for/IN ?/. For/IN readers/NNS who/WP are/VBP concerned/JJ about/IN quality/NN of/IN food/NN ,/, the/DT good/JJ news/NN is/VBZ that/IN Grub/NN really/RB pays/VBZ attention/NN to/IN the/DT produce/NN that/IN they/PRP use/VBP ./. The/DT meat/NN for/IN the/DT sausages/NNS also/RB comes/VBZ from/IN Canadian/JJ pork/NN which/WDT is/VBZ grown/JJ naturally/NN without/IN hormones/NN or/CC other/JJ growth/NN enhancers/NN ./. Their/PRP$ sausages/NNS are/VBP specially/RB made/VBD without/IN nitrites/NN which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT pink/JJ salt/NN that/WDT turns/VBZ a/DT leg/NN of/IN pork/NN into/IN the/DT familiar/JJ pink/NN ,/, springy/NN piece/NN of/IN meat/NN we/PRP all/RB know/VB as/IN ham/NN ./. They/PRP have/VB also/RB reduced/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN fats/NNS in/IN the/DT sausage/NN mix/NN ,/, so/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP after/IN healthier/JJ sausages/NNS ,/, then/RB this/DT is/VBZ certainly/RB it/PRP ./. The/DT breads/NN at/IN Grub/NNS are/VBP sourced/VBN from/IN a/DT local/NN baker/NN who/WP bakes/VBZ them/PRP to/TO their/PRP$ specifications/NNS ./. The/DT burger/NN buns/NNS are/VBP very/RB good/JJ ./. They/PRP are/VBP soft/JJ ,/, but/CC still/RB firm/JJ enough/JJ to/TO hold/VB their/PRP$ shape/NN ./. They/PRP also/RB work/VB with/IN them/PRP for/IN the/DT soft/JJ bread/NN used/VBD for/IN their/PRP$ French/NN Toast/NN ./. Of/IN the/DT few/JJ Grub/NN burgers/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ served/VBD ,/, I/PRP found/VBD the/DT Crispy/NNP Fish/NNP Burger/NNP to/TO be/VB the/DT most/JJS compelling/VBG ./. Unlike/IN most/JJ places/NNS that/WDT use/VB the/DT very/JJ common/NNP Dory/NNP fish/NN ,/, Grub/NN uses/VBZ either/RB Monkfish/JJ or/CC Haddock/RB both/DT of/IN which/WDT are/VBP sustainable/JJ white/JJ fish/NN ./. The/DT fillet/NN is/VBZ given/VBN a/DT spice/JJ rub/NN before/IN coating/VBG it/PRP with/IN breadcrumbs/NN and/CC fried/VBD ./. The/DT portion/NN is/VBZ generous/JJ and/CC served/VBD in/IN their/PRP$ specially/RB sourced/JJ bun/NN and/CC homemade/NN remoulade/NN -LRB-/IN they/PRP make/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ mayonnaise/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC comes/VBZ with/IN fries/NNS ./. Not/RB bad/JJ for/IN $/$ 12/CD ./. Their/PRP$ pork/NN steak/NN burger/NN is/VBZ very/RB popular/JJ ./. Canadian/JJ pork/NN shoulder/NN is/VBZ slow/JJ cooked/VBN for/IN 24/CD hours/NNS ,/, then/RB sliced/VBN 2/CD cm/NN thick/NN ./. So/CC you/PRP get/VB a/DT very/RB generous/JJ slab/NN of/IN tender/NN pork/NN which/WRB goes/VBZ really/RB well/RB with/IN the/DT apple/NN relish/NN ./. Personally/RB ,/, I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN it/PRP could/MD have/VB a/DT bit/NN more/NN ooomph/NN and/CC would/MD have/VB preferred/VBN it/PRP sliced/VBN thin/JJ and/CC soaked/VBD in/IN a/DT thin/JJ BBQ/NN sauce/NN ./. When/WRB I/PRP was/VBD there/RB ,/, I/PRP met/VBD some/JJ friends/NNS of/IN mine/PRP who/WP told/VBD me/PRP that/IN they/PRP were/VBD there/RB just/RB to/TO buy/VB the/DT Churros/NN for/IN takeaway/NN as/IN their/PRP$ daughter/NN loves/IN them/PRP ./. He/PRP went/VBD as/IN far/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ tasted/VBN Churros/RB from/IN around/IN the/DT world/NN and/CC the/DT Grub/NN version/NN was/VBD his/PRP$ favorite/NN ./. Served/VBN in/IN a/DT cup/NN with/IN creme/NN Anglais/NN and/CC chocolate/NN sauce/NN ,/, the/DT Churros/NN were/VBD very/RB nice/JJ and/CC crisp/JJ ./. However/RB ,/, being/VBG a/DT You/NNP Char/NNP Kway/NNP kinda/NNP guy/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB they/PRP are/VBP very/RB good/JJ but/CC I/PRP would/MD n't/RB know/VB how/WRB to/TO tell/VB if/IN they/PRP were/VBD the/DT world/NN 's/POS best/JJS as/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN has/VBZ claimed/RB ./. Unlike/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN places/NNS out/IN there/RB who/WP like/VB to/TO boast/VB that/IN they/PRP use/VBP Valhorna/JJ or/CC some/JJ other/JJ exclusive/JJ European/NN chocolates/NNS to/TO make/VB their/PRP$ desserts/NNS ,/, Chef/NN Melvyn/NN was/VBD quick/JJ to/TO admit/VB that/IN their/PRP$ Chocolate/NN pudding/NN was/VBD made/VBD from/IN Redman/JJ chocolate/NN powder/NN ./. Such/DT compromises/NN have/VBN to/TO be/VB made/VBD to/TO keep/VB the/DT prices/NN low/JJ ./. But/CC just/RB because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ made/VBD from/IN normal/JJ chocolate/NN powder/NN does/VBZ n't/RB make/VB the/DT Chocolate/NN Pudding/IN bad/JJ ./. In/IN fact/NN ,/, if/IN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB tell/VB you/PRP ,/, you/PRP would/MD be/VB enjoying/VBG your/PRP$ dessert/NN without/IN much/JJ thought/NN ,/, unless/NN of/IN course/NN ,/, you/PRP are/VBP a/DT chocolate/NN connoisseur/NN ./. For/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN us/PRP$ chocolate/NN mortals/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ alright/RB ,/, given/VBN the/DT price/NN point/NN ./. Grub/DT is/VBZ opened/VBD by/IN my/PRP$ friends/NNS Melvyn/NN and/CC Amanda/NN who/WP operate/VBZ the/DT cooking/JJ school/NN Cookyn/NN Inc./NN ./. I/PRP have/VBP known/VBN them/PRP for/IN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS now/RB and/CC they/PRP have/VBP always/RB been/VBN supporting/IN our/PRP$ ieat/JJ charity/NN events/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ their/PRP$ first/JJ venture/NN into/IN the/DT restaurant/NN business/NN and/CC they/PRP had/VBD to/TO build/VB the/DT Grub/JJ Shack/NN from/IN ground/NN up/NN ./. I/PRP think/VB they/PRP have/VBP struck/VBN a/DT good/JJ balance/NN between/IN location/NN ,/, price/NN and/CC food/NN quality/NN as/IN seen/JJ by/IN the/DT crowds/JJ lining/NN up/NN to/TO get/VB in/IN on/IN the/DT Sunday/JJ morning/NN I/PRP visited/VBD ./. Singaporeans/NNS certainly/RB have/VBN an/DT innate/JJ ability/NN to/TO spot/VB a/DT good/JJ deal/NN !/. Conclusion/NN Excellent/JJ place/NN for/IN a/DT weekend/JJ brunch/NN ./. Standalone/JJ restaurants/NN in/IN the/DT middle/JJ of/IN the/DT park/NNS are/VBP not/RB easy/VB to/TO come/VB by/IN and/CC I/PRP feel/VB that/IN Grub/PRP has/VBZ managed/VBN to/TO find/VB the/DT sweet/JJ spot/NN for/IN quality/NN ,/, price/NN and/CC environment/NN ./. The/DT only/RB downside/NN is/VBZ that/IN you/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO reserve/VB a/DT seat/NN and/CC you/PRP can/MD expect/VB a/DT queue/NN during/IN the/DT peak/NN hours/NNS ./. Ca/RB n't/RB help/VB it/PRP ,/, everybody/NNP knows/NNP a/DT good/JJ thing/NN when/WRB they/PRP see/VBP one/CD ./.
