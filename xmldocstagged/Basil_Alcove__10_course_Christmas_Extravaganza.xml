<title>Basil Alcove: 10 course Christmas Extravaganza</title>
<text>I/PRP have/VB been/VBN pestering/JJ Xander/NN to/TO do/VB a/DT since/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP ate/VBD there/RB and/CC was/VBD very/RB glad/. he/PRP finally/RB decided/VBD to/TO do/VB one/CD for/IN Christmas/NN ./. The/DT principle/NN is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ :/: Take/VB something/NN which/WDT would/MD otherwise/VB So/RB here/RB you/PRP are/VBP !!/JJ Presenting/IN the/DT 10/CD course/NN Christmas/IN Extravaganza/NNP Set/NNP Dinner/NNP Menu/NNP ,/, which/WDT I/PRP feel/VB should/VB not/RB be/VB called/VBD ``/NNP Degustation/NNP ''/NNP anymore/RB as/IN the/DT portions/NNS are/VBP really/RB quite/RB substantial/JJ !/. First/JJ up/NN is/VBZ thewhich/NN is/VBZ marinated/VBD beef/NN served/VBD rare/NN with/IN a/DT few/JJ strokes/NNS of/IN mayonnaise/NN ./. Lovers/JJ of/IN raw/JJ meats/NNS would/MD appreciate/VB this/DT !/. I/PRP still/RB like/IN my/PRP$ beef/NN cooked/VBN though/IN !/. You/PRP get/VB 3/CD mussels/NNS done/VBN in/IN 3/CD different/JJ styles/NN ./. Cheese/JJ and/CC tomato/JJ ,/, pesto/JJ and/CC white/JJ wine/NN sauce/NN ./. I/PRP liked/VBD the/DT cheese/NN and/CC tomato/NN and/CC the/DT pesto/JJ but/CC ambivalent/JJ towards/NN the/DT white/JJ wine/NN sauce/NN ./. OK/JJ ,/, after/IN a/DT shaky/JJ start/VB we/PRP start/VB to/TO get/VB to/TO the/DT good/JJ bits/NNS !/. The/DT is/VBZ reminiscent/JJ of/IN the/DT pea/NN soup/NN made/VBD famous/JJ by/IN Ferran/NN Adria/NN ./. The/DT Borscht/NN is/VBZ a/DT warm/JJ Russian/NN Soup/NN topped/VBD with/IN a/DT Cold/JJ Asparagus/NN flavored/NN froth/NN ./. Drink/CC it/PRP all/RB in/IN one/CD go/VB to/TO appreciate/VB the/DT ./. As/IN I/PRP said/JJ ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ getting/VBG interesting/JJ !/. Turkey/JJ Breast/NN is/VBZ first/JJ roasted/NN then/RB Pan/. Fried/NNP and/CC eaten/VBD with/IN a/DT dressing/VBG made/VBD from/IN Cranberries/NN ,/, Walnuts/NN and/CC Yoghurt/NN ./. Pan/JJ Frying/IN the/DT Turkey/JJ breast/NN was/VBD a/DT great/JJ twist/NN to/TO the/DT otherwise/JJ dry/JJ turkey/NN breast/NN and/CC the/DT sweetness/NN and/CC tangy/NN flavor/NN of/IN Cranberries/NN always/RB complement/VB turkey/NN so/RB well/RB ./. The/DT addition/NN of/IN yoghurt/NN gave/VBD it/PRP that/IN extra/JJ creaminess/NN which/WDT was/VBD good/JJ ,/, although/CC I/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBD more/RB cranberry/JJ and/CC less/JJ yoghurt/NN ./. The/DT description/NN on/IN the/DT Menu/NNP reads/NNP ``/NNP Assortment/NN of/IN Mushrooms/NNP ''/NNP but/CC when/WRB you/PRP get/VB down/VB to/TO it/PRP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT button/NN mushroom/NN sandwiched/VBD between/IN a/DT pair/NN of/IN Shitake/NNP Mushrooms/NNP ./. Ay/JJ ,/, Xander/NN ,/, two/CD types/NNS of/IN mushrooms/NNS do/VBP n't/RB constitute/VB an/DT ``/JJ assortment/NN ''/NN hor/NN !/. The/DT mushrooms/NNS were/VBD sauteed/NN in/IN a/DT pink/JJ peppercorn/NN sauce/NN which/WRB worked/VBD very/RB well/RB ./. Ok/JJ ,/, so/RB after/IN 5/CD very/RB interesting/JJ starters/IN we/PRP finally/RB get/VB to/TO cleanse/VB our/PRP$ palates/NN with/IN this/DT strawberry/NN sorbet/NN which/WRB was/VBD topped/VBD with/IN some/DT homegrown/JJ mint/NN pesto/NN ./. Xander/DT grows/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT herbs/NN himself/PRP because/IN some/NN of/IN these/DT European/JJ herbs/NN may/MD not/RB always/RB be/VB available/JJ in/IN the/DT Supermarkets/NN !/. Palate/JJ cleansed/NN ,/, now/RB to/TO the/DT mains/NN !/. These/DT toasted/JJ lamb/NN cutlets/NNS are/VBP really/RB very/RB good/JJ and/CC the/DT orange/JJ and/CC cherry/JJ marmalade/NN was/VBD a/DT interesting/JJ departure/NN from/IN the/DT tradtional/JJ mint/NN sauce/NN ./. The/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT lamb/NN this/DT time/NN round/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ and/CC had/VBD enough/JJ fats/NNS to/TO give/VB the/DT meat/NN a/DT strong/JJ but/CC not/RB overpowering/VB lamb/NN flavor/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD served/VBN with/IN a/DT salad/NN and/CC a/DT small/JJ serving/VBG of/IN mashed/NNP Sweet/NNP Potato/NNP which/WDT I/PRP really/RB enjoyed/VBN ./. This/DT was/VBD the/DT one/CD item/NN that/IN I/PRP really/RB wanted/VBD Xander/NN to/TO do/VB and/CC he/PRP delivered/VBZ it/PRP with/IN a/DT delightful/JJ stretch/NN of/IN the/DT imagination/NN ./. The/DT baby/NN lobster/NN was/VBD first/JJ baked/VBD and/CC covered/VBD with/IN a/DT cream/NN sauce/NN then/RB topped/VBD with/IN parmesan/NN cheese/NN and/CC grilled/VBN ./. It/PRP was/VBD served/VBN with/IN a/DT shot/NN of/IN flamin/NN '/" Kahlua/NN ,/, Grand/NN Marnier/NN and/CC Baileys/NN ./. Its/PRP the/DT kind/NN of/IN gourmet/NN moment/NN which/WDT would/MD be/VB permenantly/JJ etched/NN into/IN your/PRP$ temporal/NN lobes/NN !/. -LRB-/JJ Probably/NN not/RB for/IN everyone/NN ,/, but/CC for/IN a/DT guy/NN with/IN a/DT penchant/NN for/IN the/DT combination/NN of/IN the/DT sweet/JJ and/CC savoury/JJ ,/, this/DT was/VBD heavenly/NN !/. -RRB-/RB This/DT is/VBZ what/WP Xander/VBZ calls/RB a/DT ``/JJ deconstructed/NN ''/NN mango/NN cheese/NN cake/NN ./. ``/JJ Deconstructed/NN ''/NN just/RB means/NN ,/, ``/NN I/PRP have/VB put/VB all/RB the/DT ingredients/NNS together/RB but/CC have/VB not/RB baked/VBD it/PRP yet/RB ''/VBD ./. Slices/JJ of/IN mangoes/NNS are/VBP enveloped/VBN in/IN creamy/JJ mascapone/NN cheese/NN and/CC topped/VBD with/IN Baileys/NN and/CC blueberries/NN ./. Sticky/JJ chocolate/NN fudge/NN topped/VBD with/IN a/DT pineapple/NN and/CC coconut/NN flavored/NN cream/NN ./. I/PRP have/VB decided/VBD I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB like/IN Panna/NNP Cotta/NNP ./. Do/VBP n't/RB like/VB Ang/JJ Moh/NN desserts/NNS with/IN grated/NN coconut/NN ./. You/PRP are/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO get/VB a/DT 10/CD course/NN -LRB-/NN 11/NN if/IN you/PRP include/VB coffee/NN and/CC tea/NN -RRB-/NN meal/NN like/IN this/DT anywhere/NN else/RB for/IN $/$ 65/CD ./. The/DT courses/NNS are/VBP pretty/RB substantial/JJ with/IN only/RB one/CD item/NN in/IN 10/CD which/WDT was/VBD a/DT palate/NN cleanser/NN ./. For/IN those/RB who/WP think/VB they/PRP ca/MD n't/RB finish/VB 10/CD courses/NN ,/, there/RB is/VBZ a/DT 6/CD course/NN menu/NN which/WRB includes/VBZ the/DT first/JJ 4/CD starter/NN with/IN a/DT choice/NN of/IN either/NN lamb/NN or/CC duck/NN for/IN $/$ 32/CD and/CC a/DT 7/CD course/NN menu/NN which/WRB includes/VBZ the/DT first/JJ 5/CD items/NNS with/IN either/NNP Cod/NNP or/CC Lobster/NNP for/IN $/$ 48/CD ./. The/DT menu/NN is/VBZ only/RB valid/JJ from/IN 20-24/JJ Dec/NN and/CC is/VBZ by/IN reservations/NN only/RB ./. Hopefully/JJ if/IN this/DT concept/NN works/NN ,/, Xander/PRP might/VB offer/VB this/DT type/NN of/IN menu/NN on/IN a/DT more/JJ permanent/JJ basis/NN ./. I/PRP certainly/RB hope/VBD he/PRP would/MD !/. </text>
