<title>Rolina Curry Puffs: What did Grandpa and Grandma do after they ran away together?</title>
<text>Here/RB 's/POS a/DT little/JJ story/NN that/WDT will/MD put/VB a/DT smile/NN on/IN your/PRP$ face/NN ./. See/VB the/DT couple/NN in/IN the/DT photo/NN ?/. They/PRP are/VBP Mr/NN and/CC Mrs/NNP Tham/NNP who/WP run/VB this/DT little/JJ stall/NN in/IN Serangoon/NNP Gardens/NNP Food/NNP Centre/NN called/VBD Rolina/NN ./. Mr/NNP Tham/NNP is/VBZ now/RB 72/JJ and/CC he/PRP tells/VBZ me/PRP that/CC he/PRP has/VB been/VB selling/VBG curry/NN puffs/NN since/IN he/PRP was/VBD 19/CD ./. Mr/NNP Tham/NNP recalls/NNP that/WDT he/PRP started/VBD selling/VBG Curry/NNP Puffs/NNP back/RB in/IN the/DT 50/CD 's/POS because/CC he/PRP had/VBD no/RB education/JJ and/CC was/VBD looking/VBG for/IN something/NN to/TO do/VB ./. An/DT old/JJ Hainanese/NNP sailor/NNP chef/NN took/VBD him/PRP under/IN his/PRP$ wings/NN and/CC taught/VB him/PRP how/RB to/TO make/VB Hainanese/NNP style/NN curry/NN puffs/NN ./. The/DT retiring/NN chef/NN told/VBD him/PRP that/WDT with/IN just/RB some/JJ flour/NN and/CC potatoes/NNS that/IN he/PRP could/MD make/VB a/DT decent/JJ living/NN for/IN himself/PRP ./. So/CC he/PRP started/VBD selling/VBG his/PRP$ Curry/NNP Puffs/NNP just/RB outside/JJ Sputnik/NNP Cafe/NNP in/IN Serangoon/NNP Gardens/NNP together/RB with/IN his/PRP then/RB girlfriend/JJ ,/, pre-Mrs/JJ Tham/NN -LRB-/NN there/RB she/PRP is/VBZ in/IN the/DT photo/NN -RRB-/NN ./. Back/RB then/RB they/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VBN a/DT stall/NN ./. Instead/IN they/PRP traveled/VBP around/RB in/IN a/DT motobike/NN with/IN a/DT sidecar/JJ -LRB-/NN ala/NN Wallace/NN and/CC Gromit/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC parked/VBD the/DT vehicle/NN outside/NN of/IN the/DT cafe/NN and/CC sold/VBD their/PRP$ Curry/NNP Puffs/NNP ./. It/PRP took/VBD them/PRP 9/LS years/NNS of/IN selling/VBG curry/NN puffs/NN before/IN they/PRP saved/VB up/VB enough/JJ to/TO get/VB married/NN !/. -LRB-/DT Now/JJ ,/, is/VBZ n't/RB that/WDT sweet/JJ ?/. -RRB-/CC For/IN the/DT last/JJ 53/CD years/NNS ,/, this/DT couple/NN has/VBZ been/VBN making/VBG Curry/NNP Puffs/NNP and/CC along/IN the/DT way/NN they/PRP had/VBD four/JJ kids/NNS ,/, moved/VBD to/TO a/DT stall/NN in/IN Ang/NNP Mo/NNP Kio/NN to/TO eventually/RB open/VB a/DT bakery/NN to/TO sell/VB other/JJ stuff/NN before/IN retiring/NN to/TO this/DT little/JJ stall/NN in/IN Serangoon/NNP Gardens/NNP Way/NNP Food/NNP Centre/NN where/WRB they/PRP continue/VBD to/TO sell/VB the/DT one/CD pastry/NN that/IN ,/, as/IN Mr/NNP Tham/NNP 's/POS old/JJ Hainanese/NNP Master/NNP had/VBD predicted/NN ,/, would/MD make/VB them/PRP a/DT decent/JJ living/NN ./. According/VBG to/TO Mr/NNP Tham/NNP ,/, the/DT Curry/NNP Puffs/NNP he/PRP is/VBZ selling/VBG today/NN is/VBZ basically/RB the/DT same/JJ recipe/NN he/PRP had/VBD started/VBD with/IN 53/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./. For/IN $/$ 1.20/CD each/JJ ,/, you/PRP might/VB think/VB that/IN the/DT Curry/NNP Puffs/NNP are/VBZ a/DT tad/JJ smaller/NN than/IN their/PRP$ more/NN famous/JJ competitors/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP basically/RB reflects/VBD the/DT artisanal/NN nature/NN of/IN the/DT pastry/NN ./. All/PDT the/DT spices/NNS and/CC ingredients/NNS are/VBP still/RB prepared/VBD by/IN hand/NN and/CC the/DT Curry/NNP Puffs/NNP are/VBP made/VBD fresh/JJ everyday/NN ./. The/DT one/CD thing/NN that/WDT sets/VBZ their/PRP$ Curry/NNP Puffs/NNP apart/RB from/IN the/DT competition/NN is/VBZ the/DT crust/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ really/RB somewhere/JJ between/IN the/DT thin/JJ crust/NN of/IN a/DT Malay/JJ Epok/NN Epok/NN and/CC the/DT thicker/JJ crumbly/NN crust/NN of/IN Old/NNP Chang/NNP Kee/NNP ./. The/DT filling/NN is/VBZ a/DT tad/NN on/IN the/DT spicier/JJ side/NN which/WDT will/MD appeal/VB to/TO a/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NN I/PRP know/VB ./. Personally/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD preferred/VB it/PRP if/IN it/PRP were/VBD a/DT milder/NN curry/NN ./. But/CC otherwise/RB ,/, the/DT thinner/JJ skin/NN means/NN you/PRP can/MD get/VB to/TO eat/VB a/DT few/JJ more/NN before/IN becoming/NN too/RB full/JJ ./. 4\/5/DT Conclusion/NN So/RB are/VBP there/RB any/RB readers/NNS who/WP recognize/VB this/DT old/JJ couple/NN ?/. Anyone/PRP still/RB remember/VB them/PRP selling/VBG Curry/NNP Puffs/NNP from/IN their/PRP$ motorbike/NN and/CC sidecar/NNP outside/NNP Sputnik/NNP Cafe/NNP ?/. PS/NNP :/: Damien/NNP commented/NNP that/WDT the/DT name/NN Rolina/NN came/VBD about/IN because/IN the/DT Aunties/NN in/IN the/DT 70/NN 's/POS could/MD n't/RB pronounce/VB Novena/PRP properly/RB and/CC it/PRP turned/VBD out/IN Rolina/NN !/.
