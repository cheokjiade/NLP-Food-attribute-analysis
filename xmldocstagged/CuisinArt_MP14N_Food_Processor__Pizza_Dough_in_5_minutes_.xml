<title>CuisinArt MP14N Food Processor: Pizza Dough in 5 minutes!</title>
<text>Earlier/RBR this/DT year/NN I/PRP started/VBD to/TO make/VB my/PRP$ own/JJ Italian/NN style/NN pizza/NN ./. I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB interesting/JJ to/TO have/VB a/DT pizza/NN party/NN. where/WRB I/PRP provided/VBD the/DT base/NN and/CC everyone/NN else/RB could/MD bring/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ toppings/NNS and/CC design/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ pizza/NN ./. This/DT would/MD be/VB something/NN a/DT little/JJ different/JJ from/IN the/DT usual/JJ pot-luck/NN and/CC BBQs/NN ./. A/DT pizza/NN is/VBZ basically/RB a/DT flat/JJ yeast/NN bread/NN with/IN a/DT tomato/NN sauce/NN and/CC cheese/NN ./. Once/IN you/PRP have/VBP this/DT base/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD have/VB a/DT whale/NN of/IN a/DT time/NN thinking/VBG up/IN different/JJ types/NN of/IN toppings/NNS for/IN your/PRP$ pizza/NN ./. You/PRP can/VB of/IN course/NN buy/VB ready/JJ made/VBD bases/NN at/IN the/DT supermarket/NN ,/, but/CC making/VBG your/PRP$ own/JJ base/NN is/VBZ more/RB satisfying/JJ ./. Not/RB only/RB is/VBZ it/PRP cheaper/RB ,/, but/CC the/DT taste/NN is/VBZ 200/JJ %/: better/NN ./. Making/IN the/DT pizza/NN dough/NN is/VBZ easier/RB than/IN you/PRP think/VBP ./. It/PRP is/VBZ essentially/RB flour/NN ,/, water/NN ,/, yeast/NN ,/, salt/NN and/CC olive/NN oil/NN mixed/VBD together/RB and/CC left/JJ to/TO rise/VB ./. Now/RB the/DT key/NN to/TO a/DT great/JJ base/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO get/VB a/DT nice/JJ crumb/NN ie/IN the/DT holes/NN inside/IN the/DT crispy/NN crust/NN ./. I/PRP found/VBD that/IN the/DT secret/NN to/TO this/DT is/VBZ a/DT wet/JJ dough/NN ./. The/DT problem/NN with/IN the/DT wet/NN dough/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB difficult/JJ to/TO knead/VB it/PRP by/IN hand/NN because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ so/RB sticky/JJ that/IN you/PRP need/VBP to/TO keep/VB scraping/IN the/DT dough/NN off/IN your/PRP$ hand/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD then/RB that/IN I/PRP found/VBD out/IN that/IN you/PRP can/MD actually/RB knead/VB bread/NN dough/NN using/VBG a/DT food/NN processor/JJ and/CC best/JJ of/IN all/NN ,/, 10/CD minutes/NN of/IN hand/NN kneading/NN can/MD be/VB reduced/VBD to/TO a/DT mere/JJ 1/CD min/NN of/IN processing/NN in/IN a/DT food/NN processor/NN ./. So/CC I/PRP went/VBD off/RP to/TO buy/VB one/CD of/IN those/DT food/NN processors/NN that/IN you/PRP find/VBP at/IN Best/NN Denki/NN ./. I/PRP bought/VBD one/CD which/WDT cost/NN around/IN $/$ 170/CD which/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD was/VBD a/DT pretty/RB good/JJ machine/NN since/IN it/PRP had/VBD a/DT German/NN name/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD a/DT fantastic/JJ machine/NN when/WRB it/PRP came/VBD to/TO chopping/VB up/IN stuff/NN but/CC when/WRB I/PRP tried/VBD to/TO make/VB bread/NN dough/NN ,/, the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN started/VBD to/TO shake/NN ,/, rattle/NN and/CC roll/NN ./. So/CC I/PRP had/VBD to/TO hold/VB it/PRP down/RB with/IN my/PRP$ hands/NN to/TO make/VB sure/VB it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB leap/VB off/IN the/DT table/NN ./. Then/RB ,/, as/IN the/DT dough/NN got/VBD more/RB elastic/JJ ,/, the/DT blades/NN started/VBD to/TO slow/JJ down/NN and/CC the/DT motor/JJ overheated/NN ./. So/CC I/PRP ended/VB up/VB pulsing/VB it/PRP for/IN 20/CD seconds/NNS at/IN a/DT time/NN ./. But/CC sure/VB enough/RB ,/, after/IN a/DT few/JJ rounds/NNS of/IN wrestling/NN with/IN the/DT food/NN processor/NN ,/, I/PRP still/RB managed/VBD to/TO make/VB my/PRP$ pizza/NN dough/NN in/IN a/DT much/JJ shorter/NN time/NN than/RB if/IN I/PRP had/VBD tried/VBN to/TO knead/VB it/PRP by/IN hand/NN ./. After/IN a/DT few/JJ successful/NNP pizza/NNP parties/NNP with/IN my/PRP$ kakis/NNS ,/, I/PRP soon/RB grew/VBD fed/NN up/NN with/IN my/PRP$ plastic/NN food/NN processor/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD then/RB that/WDT I/PRP caught/VBN sight/NN of/IN the/DT CuisinArt/JJ Food/NN Processor/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT guy/NN like/IN me/PRP ,/, the/DT brushed/NNP cast/NNP metal/NNP ,/, Battlestar/NNP Galactica/NNP Cylon/NNP ,/, like/RB look/VB will/VB get/VB your/PRP$ testosterone/NN going/NN !/. My/PRP$ old/JJ food/NN processor/NN looked/VBD like/IN a/DT Kia/JJ next/JJ to/TO this/DT Porsche/NN ./. When/WRB I/PRP finally/RB managed/VBD to/TO get/VB my/PRP$ hands/NN on/IN this/DT machine/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD pure/JJ joy/NN ./. Firstly/RB the/DT thing/NN is/VBZ heavy/RB ,/, so/RB I/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VBN to/TO keep/VB holding/VBG it/PRP down/RB ./. -LRB-/. You/PRP do/VBP have/VBN to/TO hold/VB it/PRP for/IN a/DT while/NN initially/RB -RRB-/JJ Secondly/NN ,/, the/DT motor/NN was/VBD powerful/RB enough/JJ such/NN that/IN it/PRP just/RB powered/VB through/IN the/DT dough/NN ./. Every/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT machine/NN was/VBD magnificently/RB crafted/JJ and/CC solid/JJ ./. I/PRP guess/VB it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB really/RB fair/JJ to/TO compare/VB this/DT machine/NN which/WRB costs/VBZ $/$ 698/CD against/IN one/CD that/WDT costs/VBZ $/$ 169/CD but/CC you/PRP do/VB get/VB what/WP you/PRP pay/VB for/IN ./. Anyway/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP now/RB happily/JJ spinning/IN my/PRP$ one/CD minute/NN pizza/NN dough/NN with/IN the/DT CuisinArt/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN many/JJ recipes/JJ but/CC finally/RB settled/VB with/IN this/DT one/CD from/IN Jeffrey/NNP Steingarten/NNP 's/POS excellent/NN article/NN ,/, Perfection/NN Pizza/NN ./. It/PRP works/VBZ very/RB well/RB ,/, but/CC just/RB be/VB aware/NN that/IN you/PRP are/VBP dealing/VBG with/IN a/DT dough/NN that/WDT is/VBZ very/RB wet/JJ ,/, so/RB it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB look/VB like/IN the/DT dough/NN that/IN you/PRP see/VBP at/IN pizza/NN restaurants/NN ./. However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ and/CC the/DT wet/JJ dough/NN is/VBZ much/JJ easier/NN to/TO stretch/NN and/CC form/NN ./. So/RB far/JJ the/DT kakis/NNS all/DT seem/NN to/TO enjoy/VB my/PRP$ homemade/NN pizza/NN ./. 1 1\/2/DT cup/NN Bread/NN Flour/NN 1 1\/2/NN cup/NN All/PDT purpose/DT Flour/NN 1/CD teaspoon/NN yeast/NN 3\/4/NN tablespoon/NN salt/NN 1 1\/4/NN cups/NNS cold/JJ water/NN 3/CD tablespoons/NN olive/NN oil/NN Half/NN cup/NN semolina/NN flour/NN Basically/RB ,/, you/PRP add/VB all/DT the/DT dry/JJ ingredients/NNS into/IN the/DT food/NN processor/NN ,/, then/RB start/VB by/IN pulsing/VBG the/DT dry/JJ ingredients/NNS first/RB ,/, then/RB add/VB the/DT water/NN and/CC olive/NN oil/NN ./. Once/IN all/DT the/DT flour/NN and/CC the/DT water/NN is/VBZ just/RB combined/JJ ,/, stop/IN the/DT machine/NN and/CC let/VB it/PRP rest/NN for/IN 20/CD mins/NNS ./. This/DT resting/NN period/NN is/VBZ important/JJ ./. This/DT is/VBZ when/RB autolysis/JJ occurs/NN and/CC it/PRP makes/VBZ it/PRP much/RB easier/VBD to/TO get/VB that/IN nice/JJ smooth/JJ and/CC stretchable/JJ dough/NN ./. After/IN the/DT 20/CD mins/NN ,/, turn/VB the/DT food/NN processor/NN on/IN for/IN around/IN one/CD to/TO two/CD minutes/NNS and/CC you/PRP will/VB end/VB up/VB with/IN a/DT smooth/JJ gooey/JJ ,/, slime-like/JJ mess/NN ./. All/PDT you/PRP have/VB to/TO do/VB next/RB is/VBZ to/TO dust/VB it/PRP with/IN flour/NN and/CC knead/VBD a/DT couple/NN of/IN times/NNS by/IN hand/NN and/CC you/PRP will/VB get/VB a/DT dough/NN ball/NN as/IN seen/JJ above/NN ./. Just/RB leave/VB this/DT dough/NN to/TO rise/VB in/IN a/DT warm/JJ humid/NN area/NN for/IN an/DT hour/NN or/CC so/RB then/RB punch/VB it/PRP down/NN and/CC divide/NN into/IN four/JJ dough/NN balls/NNS and/CC leave/VB it/PRP to/TO rise/VB in/IN a/DT container/JJ brushed/NN with/IN a/DT thin/JJ layer/NN of/IN olive/NN oil/NN ./. You/PRP can/MD rise/VB it/PRP overnight/JJ in/IN the/DT fridge/NN or/CC for/IN about/IN 1.5/CD hours/NNS in/IN an/DT oven/NN with/IN a/DT bowl/NN of/IN hot/JJ water/NN ./. In/IN the/DT meantime/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD start/VB making/VBG the/DT tomato/NN sauce/NN ./. What/WP you/PRP need/VBP is/VBZ 2/CD cans/NNS of/IN whole/JJ tomatoes/NN ,/, garlic/NN ,/, onions/NN and/CC olive/NN oil/NN ./. Now/JJ ,/, the/DT Italians/NN do/VBP n't/RB even/RB bother/VB to/TO cook/VB their/PRP$ sauce/NN beforehand/NN ./. However/RB ,/, I/PRP personally/VB prefer/VB sauteeing/IN the/DT garlic/NN ,/, onions/NN and/CC adding/VB the/DT chopped/VBN tomatoes/NN ,/, oregano/NN ,/, salt/NN and/CC pepper/NN and/CC simmer/NN for/IN 10/CD to/TO 15/CD minutes/NNS ./. You/PRP now/RB have/VBN a/DT pizza/JJ dough/NN that/WDT is/VBZ easily/RB stretched/JJ to/TO shaped/VB and/CC a/DT tomato/NN sauce/NN to/TO go/VB on/IN top/NN of/IN it/PRP which/WDT is/VBZ now/RB ready/JJ for/IN your/PRP$ out-of-this-world/NN toppings/NNS ./. This/DT wet/NN dough/NN will/MD not/RB behave/VB like/IN the/DT ones/NNS you/PRP see/VB in/IN the/DT pizza/NN parlor/NN and/CC you/PRP wo/VBP n't/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO throw/VB it/PRP in/IN the/DT air/NN ./. But/CC ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB easy/JJ to/TO stretch/NN to/TO shape/VB and/CC the/DT texture/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ ./. You/PRP can/VB of/IN course/NN just/RB put/VB your/PRP$ pizza/NN on/IN a/DT baking/JJ tray/NN lined/NN with/IN greaseproof/NN paper/NN and/CC bake/NN it/PRP ,/, but/CC I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO do/VB it/PRP right/RB ,/, so/IN I/PRP got/VBD myself/PRP a/DT pizza/JJ stone/NN and/CC a/DT pizza/JJ peel/NN -LRB-/IN a/DT flat/JJ shovel/NN with/IN a/DT long/JJ handle/NN -RRB-/NN from/IN Sia/NNP Huat/NNP ./. It/PRP makes/VBZ the/DT pizza/JJ party/NN. all/PDT the/DT more/JJ authentic/JJ when/WRB you/PRP shovel/VB the/DT pizza/NN in/IN and/CC out/VB of/IN the/DT oven/NN !/. The/DT pizza/NN stone/NN is/VBZ important/JJ because/IN it/PRP provides/VBZ instant/JJ heat/NN from/IN underneath/JJ the/DT pizza/NN ./. The/DT stone/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB heated/NN for/IN an/DT hour/NN so/IN that/WDT when/WRB the/DT pizza/NN hits/IN the/DT stone/NN ,/, it/PRP starts/VBZ cooking/JJ immediately/NN ./. In/IN pizza/NN parlors/NN ,/, pizzas/NNS are/VBP supposed/VBN to/TO cook/VB in/IN less/JJ than/IN 2/CD minutes/NNS ./. That/DT is/VBZ because/IN wood/JJ fired/NN ovens/NN and/CC pizza/NN ovens/NN have/VBN temperatures/NNS of/IN about/IN 400/CD degrees/NNS celcius/NNS ./. But/CC our/JJ home/NN ovens/NN only/RB go/VB up/RP to/TO around/IN 220/CD degrees/NNS celcius/NNS ,/, so/RB it/PRP takes/VB about/IN 6-8/NN minutes/NN to/TO cook/VB ./. It/PRP 's/POS not/RB as/IN charred/JJ as/IN the/DT wood/JJ fired/NN ovens/NN but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB quite/RB good/JJ ./. -LRB-/. I/PRP actually/RB bought/VBD myself/PRP one/CD of/IN those/DT gas/NN burners/NNS to/TO artificially/NNP char/NNP the/DT pizza/NN just/RB for/IN kicks/NN !/. -RRB-/RB In/IN terms/NN of/IN toppings/NNS ,/, the/DT sky/NN is/VBZ the/DT limit/NN ./. Our/PRP$ kakis/NNS have/VBP brought/VBN ingredients/NNS from/IN basic/JJ stuff/NN like/IN ham/NN to/TO more/JJR adventurous/JJ stuff/NN like/IN roast/NN duck/NN ./. My/PRP$ personal/JJ favorite/NN is/VBZ sauteed/NN portabello/NN mushrooms/NNS with/IN truffle/NN oil/NN ./. My/PRP$ next/JJ pizza/NN creation/NN will/MD be/VB a/DT bacon/NN and/CC eggs/NN pizza/NN where/WRB I/PRP make/VB a/DT pizza/NN topped/VBD with/IN bacon/NN and/CC then/RB add/VB nice/JJ creamy/JJ scrambled/NN eggs/NN on/IN top/JJ ./. In/IN case/NN you/PRP are/VBP thinking/VBG of/IN getting/VBG a/DT CuisinArt/JJ food/NN processor/NN ,/, the/DT good/JJ news/NN is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP are/VBP having/VBG a/DT year/NN end/NN promotion/NN now/RB and/CC you/PRP can/VB get/VB one/CD for/IN $/$ 499/CD instead/RB of/IN the/DT usual/JJ $/$ 698/CD ./. You/PRP can/MD check/VB out/IN the/DT details/NNS at/IN the/DT Mayer/NN site/NN ,/, www.mayer.com.sg/NN ./. Have/VB fun/NN !/. </text>
