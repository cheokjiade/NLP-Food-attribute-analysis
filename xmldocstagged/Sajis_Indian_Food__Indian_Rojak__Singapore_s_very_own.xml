<title>Sajis Indian Food: Indian Rojak: Singapore's very own</title>
<text>I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB remember/VB the/DT last/JJ time/NN that/WDT I/PRP was/VBD so/RB excited/JJ about/IN an/DT Indian/JJ Rojak/NN !/. I/PRP guess/VB its/PRP$ been/VBN a/DT while/NN since/IN I/PRP have/VBP come/VBN across/IN one/CD that/WDT is/VBZ truly/JJ exceptional/NN ./. When/WRB you/PRP come/VB across/IN one/CD that/WDT has/VBZ the/DT credentials/NN of/IN Sajis/VBG it/PRP is/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO keep/VB your/PRP$ saliva/NN in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN !/. For/IN me/PRP it/PRP was/VBD the/DT sight/NN of/IN the/DT beautiful/JJ prawn/NN fritters/NN that/WDT really/RB sealed/VB the/DT deal/NN ./. Have/VB you/PRP seen/VB anything/NN so/IN magnificent/NN before/IN ?/. It/PRP was/VBD really/RB a/DT feast/NN for/IN the/DT eyes/NN and/CC a/DT tease/NN for/IN the/DT palate/NN ./. This/DT stall/NN traces/IN its/PRP$ roots/JJ all/PDT the/DT way/NN back/RB to/TO the/DT 60/CD 's/POS when/WRB current/JJ stallowner/NN ,/, Sabeek/NN 's/POS Grandfather/NN started/VBD working/VBG for/IN his/PRP$ Great/JJ Granduncle/NN in/IN the/DT Sarabat/NN stalls/NN at/IN Waterloo/NNP St/NNP near/IN the/DT old/JJ SJI/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ that/WDT in/IN those/DT days/NNS -LRB-/. I/PRP was/VBD not/RB even/RB an/DT idea/NN then/RB -RRB-/NN that/WDT was/VBD where/WRB all/PDT the/DT greatest/NN Indian/NN Food/NN and/CC Sarabat/NN stalls/NN could/MD be/VB found/VBD ./. Here/RB 's/POS an/DT interesting/JJ bit/NN of/IN history/NN that/IN I/PRP learned/VBP from/IN Sabeek/NN ./. Indian/JJ Rojak/NN is/VBZ a/DT dish/NN that/WDT was/VBD invented/RB by/IN the/DT early/NN migrants/NN to/TO Singapore/NNP ./. In/IN those/DT days/NNS ,/, the/DT Malays/NN were/VBD selling/VBG all/DT sorts/NN of/IN Kuehs/NN by/IN the/DT roadside/NN and/CC the/DT Indians/NN wanted/VBD to/TO get/VB a/DT piece/NN of/IN the/DT action/NN ./. So/CC they/PRP also/RB started/VBD to/TO make/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ Kuehs/NN to/TO sell/VB ./. Instead/JJ of/IN offering/VBG the/DT usual/JJ chilli/NN and/CC tomato/NN sauces/NNS ,/, they/PRP developed/VBN their/PRP$ own/JJ sauce/NN which/WDT has/VBZ a/DT unique/JJ combination/NN of/IN sweet/JJ ,/, sour/NN ,/, savoury/NN and/CC spiciness/NN ./. The/DT rojak/NN here/RB was/VBD really/RB fantabulous/JJ ./. So/RB good/JJ that/IN we/PRP went/VBD for/IN a/DT second/JJ round/NN of/IN rojak/NN even/RB when/WRB we/PRP were/VBD so/RB full/JJ from/IN eating/VBG the/DT chicken/NN rice/NN next/JJ door/NN ./. All/PDT the/DT stuff/NN were/VBD fresh/JJ and/CC the/DT sauce/NN was/VBD just/RB perfect/JJ ./. Amongst/IN my/PRP$ favorite/NN was/VBD the/DT Vadai/NN ./. The/DT quality/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ different/JJ from/IN what/WP I/PRP was/VBD used/VBD to/TO ./. The/DT Vadai/NN here/RB is/VBZ really/RB crumbly/JJ and/CC very/RB very/RB pang/JJ -LRB-/NN savoury/NN -RRB-/NN ./. When/WRB you/PRP put/VB it/PRP in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN ,/, it/PRP just/RB breaks/VBD apart/RB ,/, releasing/IN the/DT Umami/NN flavors/NNS of/IN the/DT lentils/NN and/CC spices/NNS ./. Shiokalingam/DT Nah/NN !/. The/DT other/JJ stuff/NN that/WDT got/VBD me/PRP real/JJ excited/NN was/VBD the/DT Mee/NNP Siam/NNP ./. I/PRP got/VBD there/RB too/RB late/JJ and/CC the/DT bee/JJ hoon/NN was/VBD sold/VBN out/RP ./. However/RB ,/, Tag/RB managed/VBD to/TO persuade/VB the/DT owner/NN to/TO give/VB us/PRP a/DT bowl/NN of/IN the/DT mee/NN siam/NN gravy/NN ./. He/PRP said/JJ that/IN it/PRP was/VBD something/NN I/PRP die/VB die/VB must/VB try/VB ./. Now/JJ Indian/NNP Mee/NNP Siam/NNP is/VBZ something/NN I/PRP have/VB not/RB tasted/VBD for/IN 20/CD years/NNS ./. The/DT Indian/NNP Mee/NNP Siam/NNP that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN indelibly/JJ etched/NN into/IN my/PRP$ psyche/NN is/VBZ the/DT one/CD that/WDT I/PRP ate/VBD for/IN 10/CD years/NNS in/IN the/DT St/NNP Andrew/NNP 's/POS School/NNP tuckshop/NNP ./. Oh/EX yeah/NN ,/, for/IN 30/CD cents/NN the/DT Indian/JJ Uncle/NN throws/IN some/DT bee/JJ hoon/NN into/IN a/DT small/JJ orange/JJ plastic/NN plate/NN and/CC pours/VB the/DT sweet/JJ mee/NN siam/NN gravy/NN over/IN it/PRP ./. Then/RB he/PRP cuts/NNS the/DT egg/NN with/IN a/DT string/NN that/WDT is/VBZ tied/JJ to/TO the/DT handle/NN of/IN the/DT big/JJ aluminum/NN pot/NN ./. You/PRP know/VBP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN it/PRP for/IN 10/CD years/NNS and/CC I/PRP suspect/VBD that/IN he/PRP has/VBZ never/RB ever/RB changed/IN the/DT string/NN !/. Anyway/RB after/IN I/PRP left/JJ school/. I/PRP never/RB came/VBD across/IN another/DT Indian/NNP Mee/NNP Siam/. again/RB until/IN last/JJ week/NN ./. I/PRP always/RB assumed/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD just/RB a/DT peculiar/JJ Tuckshop/NN food/NN ./. The/DT first/JJ taste/NN of/IN the/DT sauce/NN brought/VBN back/RB all/RB the/DT fond/NN memories/NN of/IN my/PRP$ days/NNS at/IN the/DT old/JJ St/NNP Andrew/NNP 's/POS School/NNP ./. Back/VBN in/IN the/DT days/NNS when/WRB the/DT highlight/VB of/IN school/NN was/VBD playing/RB football/JJ at/IN recess/JJ time/NN and/CC marvelling/NN at/IN the/DT tadpoles/NN in/IN the/DT big/JJ puddle/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT goal/NN posts/NNS ./. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP was/VBD your/PRP$ experience/NN with/IN Tuckshop/JJ food/NN ,/, but/CC St/NNP Andrew/NNP 's/POS Tuckshop/NN in/IN the/DT 70s/NN and/CC 80s/NN had/VBD some/DT really/RB shiok/JJ stuff/NN ./. Aside/RB from/IN the/DT Mee/NNP Siam/NNP ,/, there/RB was/VBD the/DT Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP which/WDT still/RB tastes/VBZ better/JJR than/IN most/NN of/IN the/DT Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP we/PRP eat/VBP now/RB ./. I/PRP would/MD have/VB given/VBN it/PRP a./RB I/PRP also/RB remember/VB the/DT Chai/JJ Png/NN stall/NN where/WRB students/VBZ used/VBD to/TO scoop/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ gravy/NN to/TO put/VB on/IN the/DT rice/NN ./. The/DT curry/NN gravy/NN was/VBD really/RB shiok/JJ and/CC we/PRP used/VBD to/TO fish/NN out/IN all/DT the/DT chicken/NN wing/NN tips/NN from/IN the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT pot/NN ./. So/RB was/VBD it/PRP just/RB nostalgia/NN or/CC was/VBD the/DT food/NN really/RB that/IN great/JJ ?/. Maybe/DT you/PRP can/MD share/VB your/PRP$ own/JJ experience/NN with/IN Tuckshop/JJ food/NN ?/. Seriously/RB shiok/JJ Indian/NN rojak/NN !/. Is/WBZ this/DT the/DT best/JJS or/CC is/VBZ there/RB another/JJ ?/. </text>
