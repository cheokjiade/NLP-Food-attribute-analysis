<title>The Foodie's Code</title>
<text>I/PRP believe/VB that/WDT everyone/NN who/WP considers/VBZ themselves/RB a/DT foodie/NN will/MD subconsciously/VB follow/RB a/DT set/NN of/IN unwritten/NN rules/NN ./. I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB fun/VBD to/TO list/NN these/DT down/NN so/IN we/PRP can/MD gauge/VB just/RB how/RB much/JJ of/IN a/DT foodie/NN we/PRP really/RB are/VBP ./. So/CC I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG to/TO start/VB with/IN a/DT few/JJ and/CC let/VB you/PRP all/RB suggest/VB some/DT more/JJ to/TO add/VB onto/IN the/DT list/NN !/. 1/CD ./. Never/PRP waste/VB your/PRP$ calories/NNS on/IN yukky/NN food/NN !/. 2/CD ./. One/PRP should/MD not/RB brag/VB about/IN how/RB good/JJ a/DT certain/JJ food/NN stall/NN is/VBZ without/IN telling/VBG others/JJ exactly/RB where/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ ./. 3/CD ./. A/DT real/JJ foodie/NN will/MD never/RB reject/VB someone/NN 's/POS offer/VB of/IN damn/NN shiok/NN food/NN even/RB when/WRB she/PRP is/VBZ already/RB extremely/RB full/JJ ./. 4/LS ./. If/IN someone/NN else/RB says/VBZ that/WDT something/NN is/VBZ really/RB really/RB good/JJ ,/, then/RB it/PRP behooves/IN the/DT foodie/NN to/TO at/IN least/RB give/VB it/PRP a/DT try/VB ./. 5/LS ./. The/DT only/RB thing/NN better/NN then/RB really/RB good/JJ food/NN is/VBZ when/WRB the/DT really/RB good/JJ food/NN is/VBZ free/JJ !/. 6/LS ./. Good/JJ food/NN tastes/VBZ even/RB better/JJR with/IN good/JJ company/NN !/. 7/LS ./. A/DT real/JJ foodie/NN will/MD be/VB busy/VB planning/VBG his/PRP$ next/JJ meal/NN while/NN he/PRP is/VBZ devouring/VBG his/PRP$ present/NN ./. 8/LS ./. Never/DT rely/NN on/IN the/DT recommendation/NN of/IN others/JJ ,/, trust/JJ only/RB your/PRP$ own/JJ tastebuds/NNS ./. 9/LS ./. Neither/NNP height/NNP ,/, nor/NNP depth/NNP ,/, nor/NNP distance/NNP ,/, nor/NNP price/NN ,/, nor/NN threats/NN ,/, nor/NN dangers/NN ,/, nor/NN anything/NN else/RB in/IN all/DT creation/NN will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO separate/VB the/DT foodie/NN from/IN his/PRP$ favorite/NN food/NN !/. </text>
