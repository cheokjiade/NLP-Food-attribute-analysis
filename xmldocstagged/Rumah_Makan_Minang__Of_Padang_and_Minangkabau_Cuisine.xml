<title>Rumah Makan Minang: Of Padang and Minangkabau Cuisine</title>
<text>We/PRP all/RB enjoy/VB Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP ,/, but/CC how/RB much/RB do/VB we/PRP actually/RB know/VB about/IN it/PRP ?/. I/PRP would/MD be/VB the/DT first/JJ to/TO admit/VB that/IN I/PRP am/VBP guilty/JJ of/IN calling/NN any/RB stall/NN that/WDT sells/VBZ rice/NN with/IN Malay/JJ style/NN curry/NN dishes/NNS Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP without/IN much/JJ thought/NN ./. But/CC that/WDT is/VBZ not/RB entirely/RB inaccurate/JJ as/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT dishes/NNS that/WDT are/VBP characteristic/JJ of/IN Padang/NN cuisine/NN has/VBZ become/VBN very/RB much/RB a/DT part/NN of/IN Singapore/NNP food/NNP culture/NNP ./. The/DT other/JJ problem/NN I/PRP have/VB with/IN Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP is/VBZ that/RB out/VB of/IN the/DT 50/CD or/CC so/RB dishes/NNS that/WDT are/VBP served/VBN ,/, I/PRP always/RB end/VB up/IN trying/VBG the/DT same/JJ handful/NN of/IN dishes/NNS ./. I/PRP guess/VBP I/PRP am/VBP the/DT type/NN that/IN prefers/NN to/TO play/VB safe/NN and/CC order/NN something/NN I/PRP know/VB I/PRP like/VB rather/RB than/IN taking/VBG the/DT risk/NN with/IN something/NN new/JJ ./. That/DT 's/POS exactly/RB what/WP I/PRP did/VBD on/IN my/PRP$ first/JJ visit/NN to/TO Rumah/VB Makan/NN Minang/NN ./. However/RB ,/, I/PRP came/VBD away/RB with/IN the/DT same/JJ burning/NN questions/NN ./. Just/RB what/WP is/VBZ Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP ?/. What/WP are/VBP the/DT dishes/NNS that/WDT are/VBP quintessentially/JJ Padang/NN and/CC which/WRB are/VBP Singaporean/JJ ?/. With/IN these/DT questions/NN in/IN mind/NN ,/, I/PRP organized/VBD a/DT return/NN visit/NN to/TO Rumah/VB Makan/NN Minang/NN ,/, this/DT time/NN with/IN some/JJ help/VB from/IN the/DT owners/NNS of/IN the/DT stall/NN to/TO try/VB to/TO learn/VB something/NN about/IN Padang/NN food/NN ./. The/DT most/NN famous/JJ dish/NN that/IN originated/NN from/IN Padang/NN is/VBZ probably/RB the/DT Beef/NN Rendang/NN ./. However/RB ,/, this/DT dish/NN has/VBZ become/VBN so/RB popular/JJ locally/NN that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ become/VBN become/VBN integrated/RB into/IN our/PRP$ culture/NN ./. So/RB much/JJ so/IN that/WDT most/JJ people/NNS probably/RB just/RB assume/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ local/JJ Malay/NN cuisine/NN ./. But/CC if/IN you/PRP ask/VB the/DT Minangkabau/JJ people/NN ,/, they/PRP would/MD tell/VB you/PRP that/WDT the/DT Beef/NN Redang/NN was/VBD invented/RB by/IN the/DT Minangkabau/NN ./. The/DT Minangkabau/NNS are/VBP the/DT inhabitants/NN of/IN the/DT region/NN of/IN West/NNP Sumatra/NNP whose/NNP capital/NNP is/VBZ Padang/RB ./. Legend/DT has/VBZ it/PRP that/IN the/DT Minangkabau/NNP -LRB-/NNP lit/NNP Victory/NNP over/IN the/DT Buffalo/JJ -RRB-/NNS are/VBP so/RB named/VBD because/IN of/IN a/DT famous/JJ battle/NN between/IN their/PRP$ tribe/NN and/CC the/DT forces/VB of/IN the/DT Majapahit/NN empire/NN ./. Instead/DT of/IN an/DT all/NN out/IN war/NN ,/, both/DT sides/NN decided/VBD to/TO send/VB a/DT water/NN buffalo/NN to/TO settle/VB their/PRP$ dispute/NN ./. The/DT prince/NN of/IN the/DT Majapahit/JJ empire/NN sent/IN a/DT huge/JJ beast/NN while/IN the/DT Minangkabau/JJ sent/NN a/DT hungry/JJ buffalo/NN calf/NN with/IN knives/NN strapped/NN to/TO its/PRP$ horns/NN ./. During/IN the/DT ensuing/NN battle/NN ,/, the/DT baby/NN buffalo/NN went/VBD straight/NN for/IN the/DT udders/NN of/IN the/DT big/JJ buffalo/NN and/CC pierced/VB its/PRP$ belly/JJ while/NN looking/VBG for/IN milk/NN !/. So/CC the/DT buffalo/NN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB significant/JJ animal/NN for/IN the/DT Minangkabau/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ reflected/RB in/IN the/DT architecture/NN of/IN their/PRP$ houses/NNS as/IN well/RB as/IN in/IN their/PRP$ food/NN ./. Beef/NN rendang/NN is/VBZ traditionally/RB made/VBD with/IN buffalo/NN meat/NN and/CC its/PRP$ a/DT dish/NN that/WDT is/VBZ often/RB cooked/VBN during/IN festive/CD occasions/NNS ./. Traditionally/JJ ,/, Beef/NN Rendang/NN is/VBZ cooked/VBN for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN until/IN it/PRP is/VBZ all/DT dried/JJ up/NN and/CC can/MD be/VB kept/NN for/IN a/DT whole/JJ month/NN without/IN refrigeration/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD told/VBN by/IN Hazmi/NN that/WDT there/EX are/VBP many/JJ styles/NNS of/IN Rendang/NN served/VBD in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, but/CC their/PRP$ version/NN is/VBZ close/JJ to/TO the/DT authentic/JJ Minangkabau/NN version/NN ./. ./. The/DT recipe/NN belonged/NN to/TO his/PRP$ grandmother/NN ,/, Hajjah/NN Rosemah/NN ,/, who/WP migrated/VBZ from/IN Minangkabau/NN to/TO Singapore/NNP in/IN the/DT 1940/CD 's/POS and/CC started/VBD a/DT Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP stall/NN along/IN Kandahar/NN St./. They/PRP then/RB shifted/VBD to/TO a/DT rental/JJ coffeeshop/NN in/IN the/DT 70/NN 's/POS where/WRB it/PRP was/VBD known/VBN as/IN Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP Batu/NNP Nisan/NNP -LRB-/NNP lit/NNP Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP tombstone/NNP -RRB-/NNP because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ proximity/NN to/TO a/DT tombstone/JJ maker/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD this/DT stall/NN that/WDT gave/VBD birth/NN to/TO Rumah/NNP Makan/NNP Minang/NNP ,/, Sebar/NNP Menanti/NNP and/CC Sabar/NNP Menanti/NNP II/NNP ,/, all/DT of/IN which/WDT are/VBP located/VBN within/RB walking/VBG distance/NN from/IN each/DT other/JJ in/IN Kampung/NNP Glam/NNP ./. Even/RB Warung/NN Nasi/NNP Pariaman/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT stone/NN 's/POS throw/NN away/RB belongs/VBD to/TO Hazmi/VB 's/POS Uncle/NN !/. I/PRP have/VBP always/RB enjoyed/VBN Beef/NN Rendang/NN with/IN nice/JJ ,/, tender/NN ,/, melt/NN in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN beef/NN from/IN Peramakan/NN ./. However/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ that/IN authentic/JJ Beef/NN Rendang/NN is/VBZ supposed/JJ to/TO have/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT chew/NN so/RB that/IN the/DT flavor/NN develops/NN in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB supposed/JJ to/TO be/VB spicy/JJ as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ characteristic/NN of/IN Minangkabau/NN food/NN ./. So/CC the/DT Beef/NN Rendang/NN here/RB tends/VBZ to/TO be/VB more/RB dry/JJ and/CC chewy/JJ and/CC the/DT spices/NNS do/VB pack/NN a/DT punch/NN ./. Good/JJ for/IN those/DT whose/JJ palates/NNS are/VBP used/VBD to/TO really/RB spicy/JJ food/NN ./. 4\/5/. The/DT other/JJ dishes/NNS that/IN characterize/NN Minangkabau/NN cuisine/NN are/VBZ the/DT fried/JJ dishes/NNS that/WDT are/VBP topped/VBD with/IN Belado/NN ./. Belado/DT is/VBZ essentially/RB red/JJ or/CC green/JJ chilli/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN roughly/RB chopped/VBN ,/, bruised/NN and/CC sauteed/NN with/IN onions/NN and/CC tomatoes/NN ./. I/PRP guess/VB its/PRP$ pretty/JJ much/JJ like/IN a/DT Mexican/JJ salsa/NN except/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ cooked/VBN ./. The/DT spicy/JJ ,/, tangy/JJ condiment/NN goes/VBZ really/RB well/RB with/IN fried/JJ foods/NN and/CC they/PRP usually/RB use/VB Belado/JJ Merah/NN -LRB-/NN red/JJ chilli/NN -RRB-/NN for/IN fish/NN and/CC Belado/NN Hijau/NN -LRB-/NN green/JJ chilli/NN -RRB-/NN for/IN chicken/NN ./. One/PRP tip/. I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO share/VB with/IN you/PRP is/VBZ that/IN the/DT best/JJ time/NN to/TO eat/VB Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP here/RB is/VBZ around/RB 10am/JJ when/CC the/DT food/NN has/VBZ just/RB come/VB out/IN of/IN the/DT kitchen/NN ./. By/CC the/DT time/NN I/PRP ate/VBD the/DT Ayam/NN Belado/NN Hijau/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD already/RB around/IN 2pm/NN ,/, so/RB the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD not/RB freshly/JJ fried/VBD ./. Even/RB then/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD very/RB enjoyable/JJ ./. The/DT marinade/NN for/IN the/DT fried/JJ chicken/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ and/CC the/DT sweet/JJ and/CC piquant/JJ Belado/NN hijau/NN complements/VB it/PRP perfectly/RB ./. 4\/5/. The/DT other/JJ Belado/NN dish/NN that/WDT is/VBZ famous/JJ is/VBZ the/DT Beef/NN Dendeng/NN Belado/NN which/WDT is/VBZ essentially/RB Beef/NN Jerky/NN topped/VBD with/IN Belado/NN Merah/NN ./. But/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT little/JJ adventurous/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD highly/RB recommend/VB the/DT Paru/JJ Belado/NN -LRB-/NN Beef/NN Lung/NN -RRB-/NN ./. Now/JJ ,/, I/PRP know/VBP some/JJ of/IN you/PRP might/VB cringe/VB at/IN eating/VBG offal/NN and/CC believe/VB me/PRP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT big/JJ fan/NN as/IN well/RB ,/, but/CC the/DT Paru/JJ Belado/NN here/RB is/VBZ fantastic/JJ once/RB you/PRP get/VB over/IN the/DT mental/JJ block/JJ ./. It/PRP 's/POS crispy/NN and/CC has/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ savory/JJ beefiness/NN without/IN that/DT awfully/JJ offaly/NN stench/NN ./. Actually/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ much/JJ like/IN a/DT beefy/NN keropok/NN !/. -LRB-/JJ fish/NN crackers/NN -RRB-/NN ./. Hazmi/DT explained/NN that/IN they/PRP have/VBP a/DT special/JJ method/NN of/IN preparing/VBG the/DT Paru/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ first/RB sliced/VBN thin/JJ and/CC then/RB marinated/VBD and/CC sun/RB dried/JJ before/IN deep/JJ frying/VBG !/. The/DT marinade/NN was/VBD superb/JJ at/IN masking/VBG the/DT otherwise/JJ strong/JJ smell/NN of/IN the/DT beef/NN lung/NN ,/, leaving/VBG only/RB a/DT nice/JJ savory/JJ ,/, spicy/JJ ,/, crunchy/JJ morsel/NN which/WDT was/VBD nicely/RB contrasted/VBN by/IN the/DT sweet/JJ and/CC tangy/JJ Belado/NN ./. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD I/PRP asked/VBD Hazmi/RB if/IN he/PRP had/VBD a/DT particular/JJ favorite/NN amongst/NN the/DT kaleidoscope/NN of/IN dishes/NNS he/PRP makes/VBZ everyday/JJ and/CC without/IN a/DT moment/NN 's/POS hesitation/NN ,/, he/PRP said/JJ it/PRP was/VBD the/DT Ikan/NN Bakar/NN ./. Although/CC ,/, Ikan/NN Bakar/NN is/VBZ also/RB a/DT very/RB popular/JJ Padang/NN dish/NN ,/, the/DT Ikan/NN Bakar/NN here/RB has/VBZ been/VBN modified/JJ such/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ unique/JJ to/TO Singapore/NNP ,/, or/CC indeed/RB to/TO Rumah/VB Makan/NN Minang/NN ./. The/DT traditional/JJ Padang/NN recipe/NN is/VBZ to/TO grill/VB the/DT fish/NN and/CC serve/VB it/PRP with/IN kichup/NN manis/NN -LRB-/NN sweet/JJ soy/NN sauce/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC chopped/VBN onions/NN and/CC chilli/NN ./. Here/RB the/DT fish/NN is/VBZ first/JJ slathered/NN with/IN a/DT thick/JJ and/CC yellow/JJ spice/NN mix/NN before/IN grilling/NN and/CC then/RB the/DT kichup/NN manis/NN and/CC condiments/NNS are/VBP added/VBD ./. So/CC you/PRP get/VB a/DT whole/JJ symphony/NN of/IN flavors/NNS from/IN the/DT pungency/NN of/IN the/DT onions/NN to/TO the/DT sweetness/NN of/IN the/DT kichup/NN manis/NN to/TO the/DT brightness/NN of/IN the/DT chillies/NND balancing/VB out/IN the/DT umami/NN flesh/NN of/IN the/DT Ikan/NNP Selar/NNP Panjang/NNP -LRB-/NNP Indian/NNP Mackeral/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. Again/RB ,/, something/NN best/JJS enjoyed/VBN fresh/VB out/VB of/IN the/DT grill/NN !/. Botok/JJ Botok/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN those/DT dishes/NNS that/WDT I/PRP would/MD never/RB have/VB ordered/VBD by/IN myself/PRP ./. This/DT is/VBZ essentially/RB a/DT piece/NN of/IN Batang/NNP -LRB-/NNP Mackeral/NNP -RRB-/NNP topped/VBD with/IN a/DT mix/NN of/IN coconut/NN and/CC herbs/NN ,/, wrapped/NN in/IN banana/NN leaves/VBZ and/CC steamed/JJ ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ like/IN an/DT otak/JJ otak/NN but/CC with/IN the/DT fish/NN whole/JJ and/CC separated/JJ from/IN the/DT rempah/NN ./. The/DT flavors/NNS are/VBP nice/JJ but/CC I/PRP found/VBD the/DT leaves/VBZ a/DT little/JJ grassy/JJ and/CC difficult/JJ to/TO chew/VB ./. Still/IN its/PRP$ something/NN you/PRP might/VB like/VB to/TO order/VB just/RB to/TO try/VB something/NN new/JJ and/CC different/JJ ./. The/DT one/CD dish/NN that/IN I/PRP will/MD always/RB order/VB whenever/IN I/PRP am/VBP back/RB at/IN Rumah/NNP Makan/NNP Minang/NNP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT Tahu/JJ Telor/NN ./. Firstly/RB because/IN their/PRP$ version/NN is/VBZ very/RB very/RB good/JJ and/CC secondly/JJ ,/, the/DT sweet/JJ sauce/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ served/VBD with/IN brings/NN a/DT bit/NN of/IN respite/NN in/IN the/DT midst/NN of/IN the/DT explosion/NN of/IN spices/NNS from/IN the/DT other/JJ dishes/NNS ./. Theirs/DT is/VBZ smaller/RB in/IN comparison/NN with/IN the/DT Tahu/NN Telor/NN served/VBD in/IN many/JJ other/JJ places/NNS and/CC is/VBZ quartered/RB then/RB fried/VBD such/NN that/WDT there/EX is/VBZ more/RB crispy/JJ bits/NNS to/TO savor/VB ./. It/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ to/TO know/VB that/WDT we/PRP will/VB be/VB able/JJ to/TO enjoy/VB the/DT dishes/NNS of/IN Rumah/NN Makan/NN Minang/NN for/IN at/IN least/RB another/DT generation/NN as/IN the/DT baton/NN is/VBZ gradually/JJ being/NN passed/NN onto/IN Hazmi/NN who/WP gave/VBD up/IN his/PRP$ job/NN as/IN an/DT IT/JJ engineer/NN to/TO carry/VB on/IN the/DT family/NN tradition/NN ./. Aside/RB from/IN renovating/VBG the/DT restaurant/NN and/CC giving/VBG his/PRP$ restaurant/NN a/DT strong/JJ online/NN presence/NN ,/, he/PRP is/VBZ also/RB in/IN the/DT kitchen/NN getting/VBG his/PRP$ elbows/JJ dirty/NN and/CC learning/VBG all/PDT the/DT recipes/NN from/IN his/PRP$ mom/NN !/. So/CC it/PRP 's/POS great/JJ to/TO see/VB this/DT restaurant/NN bringing/NN tradition/NN into/IN the/DT 21st/CDD century/NN while/NN still/RB celebrating/IN its/PRP$ heritage/NN !/. Do/VBP n't/RB hesitate/VB to/TO order/VB a/DT cup/NN of/IN Teh/NNP Tarik/NN to/TO accompany/VB your/PRP$ food/NN while/IN you/PRP are/VBP there/RB ./. Hazmi/DT 's/POS father/NN has/VBZ represented/JJ Singapore/NN as/IN our/JJ Teh/NNP Tarik/NNP ambassador/NNP overseas/NN on/IN several/JJ occasions/NNS and/CC so/RB the/DT Teh/NNP Tarik/NNP here/RB is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ./. The/DT key/NN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB special/JJ blend/NN of/IN tea/NN they/PRP use/VBP which/WDT is/VBZ specially/RB blended/VBD just/RB for/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./. It/PRP has/VBZ hints/NN of/IN rose/NN and/CC vanilla/NN flavors/NNS so/IN its/PRP$ fragrant/JJ while/IN the/DT astringency/NN is/VBZ nicely/RB balanced/VBN with/IN the/DT condensed/NN milk/NN so/RB that/IN its/PRP$ smooth/JJ and/CC brisk/JJ ./. Conclusion/NN The/DT legacy/NN of/IN Hajjah/NN Rosemah/NN and/CC Minangkabau/NN food/NN lives/NN on/IN Rumah/NNP Makan/NNP Minang/NNP and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ to/TO know/VB that/WDT there/EX is/VBZ a/DT new/JJ generation/NN that/WDT will/MD take/VB over/IN the/DT baton/NN and/CC bring/VB it/PRP to/TO the/DT 21st/CDD century/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ no/RB surprise/JJ that/IN Padang/JJ food/NN is/VBZ so/RB popular/JJ throughout/NN Indonesia/NN as/IN well/RB as/IN Singapore/NNP and/CC Malaysia/NNP ./. When/WRB you/PRP are/VBP really/RB hungry/JJ ,/, a/DT plate/NN of/IN rice/NN and/CC accompanied/VBN by/IN a/DT few/JJ dishes/NNS will/VB surely/NN hit/NN that/IN gastronomic/NN g-spot/NN ./.
