<title>Loong Fatt: And the First Shall be the Last...</title>
<text>In/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ post/NN on/IN the/DT Tau/NNP Sar/NNP Piah/NNP ,/, I/PRP gave/VBD a/DT brief/NN history/NN of/IN how/RB the/DT Tau/NNP Sar/NNP Piah/NNP came/VBD about/IN ./. So/RB this/DT blog/NN would/MD not/RB be/VB complete/VBD if/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB feature/NN the/DT shop/NN from/IN which/WDT this/DT Singaporean/NN Confectionery/NN actually/RB first/RB made/VBD its/PRP$ appearance/NN ./. Yes/EX ,/, it/PRP was/VBD here/RB that/IN the/DT Tau/NNP Sar/NNP Piah/NNP craze/VB started/VBD and/CC gained/JJ momentum/NN resulting/NN in/IN several/JJ shops/NN sprouting/NN up/NN along/IN the/DT Balestier/NNP area/NN cashing/NN in/IN on/IN the/DT craze/VB ./. When/WRB the/DT dust/NN finally/RB settled/NN ,/, the/DT one/CD left/JJ with/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN blowing/VBG the/DT smoke/NN from/IN the/DT gun/NN barrel/NN is/VBZ Loong/NNP Fatt/NNP ./. Business/DT is/VBZ still/RB very/RB good/JJ in/IN the/DT venerable/JJ old/JJ shophouse/NN which/WRB sells/VBZ other/JJ cakes/NNS and/CC confectioneries/JJ as/IN well/RB ./. But/CC it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT Tau/NNP Sar/NNP Piah/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ still/RB the/DT star/NN of/IN the/DT coffeeshop/NN ./. Freshly/RB baked/VBD Tau/NNP Sar/NNP Piah/NNP with/IN a/DT cup/NN of/IN Kopi/NN or/CC Teh/NNP must/MD be/VB one/CD of/IN those/DT unique/JJ Singaporean/NN pleasures/NN that/IN you/PRP are/VBP not/RB going/VBG to/TO find/VB anywhere/RB else/RB in/IN the/DT world/NN ./. The/DT crust/NN is/VBZ fragrant/JJ albeit/NN a/DT little/JJ oily/JJ ,/, crisp/JJ and/CC savoury/JJ ./. Great/JJ with/IN that/WDT hot/JJ cup/NN of/IN Teh/NNP Tarik/NNP !/. Its/PRP survival/NN of/IN the/DT fittest/NN and/CC this/DT stall/NN obviously/NN has/VBZ a/DT big/JJ fan/NN base/NN to/TO keep/VB them/PRP going/NN ./. </text>
