<title>VITAGEN: Prebiotics and Probiotics!</title>
<text>Advertorial/. The/DT WHO/NN defines/NN Probiotics/NN as/IN ``/JJ Live/NN microorganisms/NN which/WDT when/WRB administered/VBD in/IN adequate/NNP amounts/NNP confer/NNP a/DT health/JJ benefit/NN on/IN the/DT host/VB ''/NN ./. Unless/WP you/PRP have/VBP been/VBN living/VBG on/IN a/DT mountain/NN and/CC hiding/NN under/IN a/DT shell/NN -LRB-/NN ie/IN Sua/NNP Gu/NNP -/: Mountain/NNP Tortoise/NNP -RRB-/NNP ,/, you/PRP would/MD not/RB doubt/VB have/VBN heard/VBN about/IN Probiotics/NN by/IN now/RB ./. Essentially/JJ ,/, Probiotics/NNS are/VBP strains/JJ of/IN ``/PRP$ Good/JJ ''/NN bacteria/NN which/WDT ,/, when/WRB ingested/NN ,/, sort/NN of/IN make/VB their/PRP$ home/NN in/IN your/PRP$ digestive/NN system/NN and/CC prevent/VB the/DT ``/JJ Bad/NN ''/NN bacteria/NN from/IN taking/VBG up/IN residence/RB there/RB ./. The/DT goodness/NN of/IN probiotics/NN have/VBN been/VBN known/VBN for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ./. Since/IN ancient/NN history/NN ,/, people/NN knew/VBD that/IN eating/NN Yoghurt/NN was/VBD good/JJ for/IN your/PRP$ digestive/NN health/NN ./. But/CC it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB until/IN the/DT 20th/JJ century/NN that/IN a/DT Russian/JJ Scientist/NN by/IN the/DT name/NN of/IN Ã‰lie/NNP Metchnikoff/NNP proposed/NNP that/WDT it/PRP might/VB be/VB possible/JJ to/TO alter/VB gut/RB flora/VBD by/IN replacing/VBG the/DT bad/JJ bacteria/NN with/IN good/JJ bacteria/NN ./. That/DT was/VBD when/WRB the/DT addition/NN of/IN Probiotics/NN in/IN our/PRP$ food/NN started/VBD to/TO take/VB off/IN ./. Nowadays/RB you/PRP can/MD find/VB infant/JJ formulas/NN with/IN Probiotics/NN as/IN well/RB as/IN cultured/JJ milk/NN drinks/NNS with/IN special/JJ strains/NN of/IN Lactobacillus/NN in/IN the/DT supermarkets/NN ./. The/DT other/JJ time/NN when/WRB you/PRP are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO encounter/VB Probiotics/PRP is/VBZ when/WRB you/PRP visit/VB your/PRP$ doctor/NN with/IN diarrhoea/NN ./. You/PRP might/VB be/VB given/VBN sachets/NN of/IN Probiotics/NN which/WDT you/PRP ingest/VB to/TO help/VB put/VB back/RB the/DT good/JJ bacteria/NN and/CC drive/VB out/IN the/DT diarrhoea/JJ causing/NN ones/NNS !/. So/CC you/PRP know/VB about/IN Probiotics/NN ,/, but/CC perhaps/JJ not/RB so/RB much/JJ about/IN Prebiotics/NN right/NN ?/. Prebiotics/NNS are/VBP a/DT much/RB newer/JJR development/NNS and/CC were/VBD only/RB identified/JJ and/CC named/VBD by/IN Marcel/NN Roberfroid/NN in/IN 1995/NN ./. Essentially/JJ ,/, they/PRP are/VBP non-absorbable/JJ carbohydrates/NN that/WDT stay/VB in/IN the/DT gut/NN and/CC act/NN as/IN a/DT food/NN source/NN for/IN the/DT good/JJ bacteria/NN ./. So/RB when/WRB you/PRP take/VB a/DT Prebiotic/NN with/IN a/DT Probiotic/NN ,/, what/WP you/PRP are/VBP essentially/RB doing/VBG is/VBZ to/TO create/VB an/DT optimal/JJ environment/NN for/IN the/DT Probiotic/NN to/TO work/VB ./. According/VBG to/TO the/DT Mayo/JJ Clinic/NN Website/NN ,/, there/RB is/VBZ encouraging/JJ evidence/NN that/WDT Probiotics/PRP are/VBP useful/JJ for/IN treating/JJ things/NNS like/IN irritable/NNP bowel/NNP syndrome/NN ,/, eczema/NN in/IN children/NN ,/, diarrhoea/NN and/CC vaginal/NN yeast/NN infections/NN ,/, although/CC they/PRP stress/VBD that/IN more/NN research/NN is/VBZ needed/RB ./. So/RB what/WP that/WDT means/NN is/VBZ that/IN Probiotics/PRP may/MD not/RB yet/RB be/VB a/DT sure/JJ cure/NN for/IN all/DT these/DT ailments/NN ,/, but/CC there/RB sure/JJ is/VBZ no/RB harm/RB trying/VBG !/. Aside/RB from/IN the/DT addition/NN of/IN Prebiotics/NN ,/, VITAGEN/RB has/VB also/RB decreased/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN sugar/NN in/IN by/IN as/IN much/JJ as/IN 50/CD %/: compared/VBN to/TO other/JJ regular/NN cultured/NN milk/NN drinks/NNS ./. This/DT is/VBZ a/DT welcome/JJ development/NN as/IN I/PRP have/VBP always/RB felt/VBD that/WDT we/PRP feed/VB our/PRP$ kids/NNS too/RB much/JJ sugar/NN ./. A/DT lot/NN of/IN ``/NN healthy/JJ ''/NN foods/NN that/IN parents/NN give/JJ to/TO kids/NNS are/VBP loaded/VBN with/IN sugar/NN which/WDT I/PRP believe/VB is/VBZ contributing/JJ to/TO the/DT increasing/VBD obesity/NN amongst/NN our/JJ kids/NNS ./. Many/JJ of/IN the/DT cereals/NN ,/, food\/drinks/RB contain/VB too/RB much/JJ sugar/NN and/CC should/MD n't/RB be/VB considered/VBD ``/RB healthy/JJ ''/NN foods/NN for/IN our/PRP$ kids/NNS ./. So/RB as/IN parents/NN ,/, we/PRP should/MD be/VB on/IN the/DT look/VB out/VB for/IN ``/DT less/JJ sugar/NN ''/NN alternatives/NN when/WRB we/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG our/PRP$ grocery/NNS shopping/VBG ./. So/CC the/DT next/JJ time/NN you/PRP are/VBP at/IN the/DT supermarket/NN picking/NN up/IN some/JJ cultured/NN milk/NN drink/NN for/IN the/DT kids/NNS ,/, do/VB bear/RB in/IN mind/NN that/WDT not/RB all/DT cultured/JJ milk/NN drinks/NNS are/VBP the/DT same/JJ ./. VITAGEN/DT has/VBZ the/DT extra/JJ addition/NN of/IN Prebiotics/NN as/IN well/RB as/IN the/DT benefit/NN of/IN having/VBG less/JJ sugar/NN ./. So/RB so/RB make/VB an/DT informed/JJ decision/NN when/WRB choosing/VBZ what/WP to/TO buy/VB ./. </text>
