<title>Inagiku: Chirashi sushi Experience</title>
<text>My/PRP$ wife/NN would/MD be/VB pleasantly/RB surprised/VBD ,/, and/CC my/PRP$ mom/NN who/WP look/VB to/TO heaven/VB with/IN thanksgiving/NN if/IN they/PRP found/VBD out/IN that/WDT I/PRP actually/RB ate/VBD a/DT bowl/NN of/IN rice/NN with/IN raw/JJ seafood/NN on/IN top/JJ !/. You/PRP see/VBP ,/, I/PRP grew/VBD up/RP with/IN seafood-phobia/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD not/RB until/IN I/PRP met/VBD my/PRP$ wife/JJ -LRB-/NN girlfriend/NN then/RB -RRB-/VB that/IN her/PRP family/NN introduced/VBD me/PRP to/TO seafood/NN ./. There/EX was/VBD a/DT stage/NN in/IN my/PRP$ life/NN where/WRB I/PRP would/MD never/RB touch/VB anything/NN that/WDT swims/VBZ ./. But/CC slowly/VB that/IN all/DT changed/NN ./. Wives/PRP do/VB have/VB a/DT way/NN of/IN transforming/NN their/PRP$ husbands/NN as/IN you/PRP well/RB know/VBP ,/, so/RB I/PRP became/VBD more/RB open/JJ to/TO seafood/NN ,/, though/CC not/RB really/RB a/DT big/JJ fan/NN ,/, preferring/NN hoofs/NN to/TO fins/VB anytime/NN ./. So/RB for/IN a/DT guy/NN like/IN that/WDT to/TO devour/VB a/DT whole/JJ bowl/NN of/IN raw/JJ seafood/NN must/MD be/VB nothing/NN short/NN of/IN a/DT born-again/JJ experience/NN ./. The/DT transformation/NN from/IN seafood/NN phobia/NN to/TO seafood/NN philia/NN was/VBD gradual/RB ./. My/PRP$ problem/NN with/IN seafood/NN at/IN first/JJ was/VBD because/IN I/PRP was/VBD introduced/VBN to/TO the/DT really/RB fishy/JJ fish/NN instead/RB of/IN white/JJ fish/NN ./. Gradually/JJ ,/, I/PRP somehow/VB learned/VB that/WDT fish/NN and/CC chips/NNS were/VBD actually/RB quite/RB nice/JJ ./. Then/RB I/PRP learned/VBD that/IN steamed/JJ Coral/NN Trout/NN with/IN ginger/NN and/CC shallots/NN was/VBD also/RB quite/RB nice/JJ ./. But/CC the/DT leap/NN from/IN eating/VBG fish/NN to/TO eating/VBG raw/JJ fish/NN was/VBD yet/RB another/JJ hurdle/NN which/WDT I/PRP eventually/RB crossed/VBD because/IN I/PRP was/VBD absolutely/RB intrigued/VBN by/IN the/DT Sushi/NN Culture/NN ./. That/DT led/VBD to/TO a/DT lot/NN of/IN research/NN into/IN fish/NN and/CC suddenly/RB I/PRP realized/VB -LRB-/VB the/DT ignoramus/NN that/IN I/PRP am/VBP -RRB-/VBG that/WDT there/EX are/VBP plenty/JJ of/IN fish/NN in/IN the/DT ocean/NN and/CC they/PRP all/RB taste/VB different/JJ !/. Then/RB there/RB are/VBP the/DT health/NN benefits/NN of/IN eating/VBG fish/NN too/RB ./. Unlike/NNP animal/NNP meat/NN which/WRB contain/VB fats/NNS ,/, fish/NN meat/NN contain/VB oils/NN which/WDT are/VBP cardioprotective/JJ ./. So/RB now/RB I/PRP find/VB myself/PRP trying/VBG to/TO order/VB fish/NN instead/RB of/IN steak/NN at/IN restaurants/NN ./. I/PRP have/VB Chef/NN Nogawa/NN to/TO thank/VB for/IN helping/VBG me/PRP to/TO appreciate/VB sushi/NN ./. I/PRP never/RB did/VBD like/IN Sushi/NN until/IN I/PRP ate/VBD Sushi/NN at/IN the/DT counter/NN ./. Here/RB is/VBZ where/WRB you/PRP can/MD interact/VB with/IN the/DT itamae/JJ -LRB-/NN Sushi/NN Chef/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC learn/NN about/IN the/DT fish/NN you/PRP are/VBP eating/VBG as/IN well/RB as/IN appreciate/VB the/DT hand/NN molded/NN sushi/NN rice/NN ./. The/DT next/JJ logical/NN step/NN after/IN Nigiri/NNP Sushi/NNP -LRB-/. The/DT ones/NNS with/IN the/DT fish/NN on/IN top/JJ -RRB-/NN is/VBZ of/IN course/NN Chirashi/NN Sushi/NN which/WRB basically/VBZ is/VBZ a/DT bowl/NN of/IN rice/NN with/IN all/DT the/DT seafood/NN piled/NN on/IN top/JJ ./. To/WP me/PRP ,/, this/PRP seems/VBZ like/IN the/DT kind/NN of/IN thing/NN a/DT Japanese/NN mom/NN would/MD serve/VB her/PRP family/NN when/WRB there/EX is/VBZ no/RB time/NN to/TO cook/VB a/DT proper/NN meal/NN ./. I/PRP have/VB a/DT few/JJ kakis/NNS who/WP love/VB this/DT way/NN of/IN eating/VBG raw/JJ fish/NN and/CC they/PRP would/MD swear/VB by/IN it/PRP ./. So/NNP Chirashi/NNP Sushi/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN on/IN my/PRP$ to-do/NN list/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB impressive/JJ bowl/NN of/IN Chirashi/NN Sushi/NN to/TO say/VB the/DT least/RB ./. And/CC so/RB it/PRP should/MD be/VB at/IN $/$ 150/CD per/NN bowl/NN ./. The/DT seafood/NN reflects/IN the/DT Spring/JJ catches/NN from/IN the/DT historic/JJ fishing/NN towns/NNS of/IN Uwajima/NN and/CC Sanriku/NN and/CC you/PRP can/MD expect/VB all/DT the/DT good/JJ stuff/NN like/IN Otoro/NN ,/, Uni/NN ,/, Snow/NNP Crab/NNP ,/, Hottate/NNP ,/, Anago/NNP etc/UH etc./LS ./. Everything/NNP is/VBZ top/JJ quality/NN and/CC they/PRP all/RB taste/VB fresh/JJ to/TO me/PRP ,/, but/CC to/TO be/VB honest/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD be/VB hard/JJ pressed/NN if/IN you/PRP ask/VBP me/PRP if/IN the/DT freshness/NN is/VBZ worth/JJ $/$ 150/CD since/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB get/VB to/TO eat/VB this/DT that/WDT often/NN ./. Everytime/. I/PRP eat/VB Sushi/NN ,/, I/PRP learn/VBD a/DT bit/NN more/NN about/IN it/PRP ./. On/IN the/DT past/IN few/JJ occasions/NNS ,/, I/PRP had/VBD wondered/VBN why/WRB Otoro/PRP sometimes/RB looked/VBD like/IN Pork/NNP Belly/NNP -LRB-/NNP ie/IN layered/VBN -RRB-/JJ and/CC sometimes/RB like/VB Karubi/NN -LRB-/IN fine/JJ reticular/NN fat/NN interspersed/NN between/IN the/DT fibers/NN -RRB-/NN ./. Well/RB ,/, it/PRP turns/VBZ out/IN that/WDT there/EX are/VBP two/CD types/NNS of/IN Otoro/NN ./. There/EX is/VBZ the/DT layered/VBN type/NN known/VBN as/IN dandara/NN which/WRB resembles/VBZ pork/NN belly/NN ,/, and/CC there/RB is/VBZ the/DT Shimofuri/JJ type/NN which/WDT is/VBZ described/JJ as/IN having/VBG a/DT ``/JJ falling/NN frost/NN ''/NN pattern/NN ./. I/PRP had/VBD a/DT slice/NN of/IN this/DT in/IN my/PRP$ bowl/NN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD absolutely/RB delectable/JJ ./. The/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT seafood/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, but/CC this/DT one/CD slice/NN of/IN otoro/NN was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS I/PRP have/VBP tasted/VBN ./. The/DT reason/NN that/IN the/DT Japanese/NN love/VBP Tuna/NNP so/RB much/JJ ,/, which/WDT regrettably/VB has/VB led/VBD to/TO overfishing/NN ,/, is/VBZ that/IN the/DT Tuna/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT very/RB few/JJ fishes/NNS which/WRB have/VBN fats/NNS that/WDT are/VBP interspersed/JJ between/IN the/DT muscle/NN fibers/NN ./. Most/JJS other/JJ fish/NN have/VBZ their/PRP$ fat/JJ concentrated/NN in/IN one/CD spot/NN ./. This/DT peculiar/NN anatomy/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT reasons/NN why/WRB the/DT Tuna/NNP ,/, unlike/RB any/DT other/JJ fish/NN ,/, have/VB the/DT ability/NN to/TO raise/VB its/PRP$ internal/JJ temperature/NN to/TO 18/VB degrees/NNS above/IN the/DT temperature/NN of/IN the/DT sea/JJ water/NN around/IN it/PRP ./. I/PRP was/VBD particulary/JJ impressed/NN with/IN the/DT Tempura/NN at/IN Inagiku/NN which/WRB was/VBD served/VBD as/IN part/NN of/IN our/PRP$ media/NN tasting/VBG menu/NN ./. I/PRP found/VBD out/IN later/NN that/IN Inagiku/NN started/VBD out/IN almost/RB 150/CD years/NNS ago/RB in/IN 1866/NN as/IN a/DT Tempura/JJ restaurant/NN in/IN Asakusa/NN ./. Is/WBZ it/PRP a/DT coincidence/NN or/CC is/VBZ deep/JJ fried/VBD food/NN a/DT rage/NN in/IN the/DT 1860/NN 's/POS given/VBN that/IN the/DT English/NNP Fish/NNP n/NNP Chips/NNP was/VBD believed/VBN to/TO have/VB been/VBN founded/VBN in/IN Oldham/NN in/IN 1860/NN ?/. Anyway/RB the/DT Tempura/NN at/IN Inagiku/NN is/VBZ famous/JJ and/CC a/DT lot/NN of/IN it/PRP has/VBZ to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT super/RB fine/JJ sesame/NN oil/NN that/IN they/PRP use/VBP for/IN deep/JJ frying/VBG ./. Even/RB in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, the/DT deep/JJ frying/VBG oil/NN is/VBZ specially/RB imported/VBN from/IN Japan/NNP and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ this/DT oil/NN that/WDT gives/VBZ the/DT Tempura/NN that/IN special/JJ flavor/NN which/WDT is/VBZ made/VBD even/RB better/RBR when/WRB dipped/NN into/IN their/PRP$ special/JJ dipping/NN sauce/NN ./. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD Conclusion/NN Would/MD I/PRP specially/RB order/VB Chirashi/NN Sushi/NN again/RB ?/. No/DT not/RB really/RB ./. I/PRP think/VB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT lover/NN seafood/NN and/CC want/VB all/DT your/PRP$ seafood/NN on/IN one/CD bowl/NN ,/, then/RB it/PRP is/VBZ for/IN you/PRP ./. I/PRP prefer/VB to/TO eat/VB nigiri/NN sushi/NN on/IN the/DT bar/NN where/WRB the/DT rice/NN is/VBZ freshly/JJ pressed/NN and/CC I/PRP can/MD take/VB my/PRP$ time/NN to/TO savor/VB each/JJ slice/NN of/IN seafood/NN ./. Inagiku/DT is/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ place/NN for/IN a/DT great/JJ Tempura/NN experience/NN though/IN ,/, but/CC be/VB advised/VBD that/WDT if/IN you/PRP want/VB to/TO taste/VB that/IN special/JJ refined/NN sesame/NN oil/NN ,/, you/PRP have/VBP to/TO be/VB ready/JJ to/TO pay/VB for/IN it/PRP ./. Inagiku/JJ Level/NN 3/CD ,/, Fairmont/NNP Singapore/NNP 80/CD Bras/NNP Basah/NNP Road/NNP Singapore/NNP 189560/NNP TEL/NNP +65/NNP 6339/NNP 7777/. This/PRP review/VB is/VBZ based/VBD on/IN a/DT media/JJ review/VB session/NN hosted/VBD by/IN Inagiku/NN to/TO introduce/VB their/PRP$ new/JJ Sushi/NN Chef/NN ,/, Chef/NN Hiro/NN ,/, and/CC also/RB to/TO highlight/VB the/DT spring/JJ harvest/NN ./. The/DT dishes/NNS shown/RB are/VBP smaller/JJ portions/NNS as/IN they/PRP are/VBP part/NN of/IN the/DT media/JJ review/VB menu/NN ./. </text>
