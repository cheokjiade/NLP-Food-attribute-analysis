<title>Prince Taiwan Porridge: It's 2am and I need something to warm my tummy!</title>
<text>Do/VBP you/PRP know/VB what/WP is/VBZ the/DT difference/NN between/IN Taiwan/NNP Porridge/NNP and/CC Teochew/NNP Porridge/NNP ?/. No/JJ I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mean/VB the/DT dishes/NNS ,/, I/PRP mean/VB the/DT porridge/NN itself/PRP ./. I/PRP just/RB found/VBD out/IN that/IN aside/NN from/IN the/DT addition/NN of/IN sweet/JJ potatoes/NNS ,/, So/CC real/JJ Taiwanese/NN porridge/NN is/VBZ very/RB much/JJ stickier/NN than/IN Teochew/NNP porridge/NNP ./. However/RB ,/, because/IN Singaporeans/NNS are/VBP more/JJ used/VBD to/TO the/DT Teochew/NNP version/NN ,/, this/DT stall/NN makes/VBZ its/PRP$ porridge/JJ from/IN a/DT mixture/NN of/IN short/NN grain/NN and/CC jasmine/NN rice/NN ./. Whenever/WP I/PRP eat/VBP Taiwan/JJ Porridge/NN ,/, I/PRP usually/RB order/VB the/DT same/JJ stuff/NN ./. I/PRP think/VB most/NN of/IN us/PRP$ tend/NN to/TO be/VB that/WDT way/NN ./. Either/JJ because/IN we/PRP are/VBP creatures/JJ of/IN habit/NN or/CC we/PRP are/VBP Kiasu/JJ and/CC not/RB wanting/VBG to/TO waste/VB our/PRP$ calories/NNS on/IN something/NN that/WDT is/VBZ not/RB nice/JJ ./. So/RB ,/, the/DT cold/JJ tofu/NN is/VBZ quite/RB a/DT standard/JJ dish/NN for/IN me/PRP ./. I/PRP found/VBD this/DT particular/JJ sauce/NN a/DT bit/NN too/RB salty/NN and/CC less/JJ sweet/JJ then/RB others/JJ ./. I/PRP did/VBD not/RB like/VB it/PRP but/CC ieatMrs/JJ and/CC skinnyfoodie/RB did/VBD ./. But/CC since/IN I/PRP am/VBP rating/NN it/PRP ,/, it/PRP gets/VBZ $/$ 4/CD The/DT Kong/NNP Bak/NNP Pau/NNP was/VBD good/JJ ./. The/DT buns/NNS here/RB are/VBP specially/RB made/VBD to/TO order/VB and/CC were/VBD really/RB very/RB big/JJ and/CC fluffy/JJ ./. One/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ ones/NNS -LRB-/IN the/DT buns/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ -RRB-/RB I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN ./. The/DT Kong/NNP Bak/NNP was/VBD tasty/JJ and/CC really/RB tender/JJ ./. It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ but/CC it/PRP lacked/VBD that/IN OOmph/NN factor/NN to/TO make/VB it/PRP a/DT die/VB die/VB must/VB try/VB ./. $/$ 12/CD for/IN a/DT set/NN that/WDT makes/VBZ 6/LS ./. ./. Still/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ well/RB worth/JJ trying/VBG if/IN you/PRP are/VBP yearning/JJ for/IN a/DT good/JJ KBP/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN ./. The/DT chicken/NN in/IN wine/NN sauce/NN was/VBD ok/RB ./. When/WRB you/PRP eat/VB it/PRP ,/, you/PRP know/VB that/WDT the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD prefried/JJ and/CC the/DT sauce/NN was/VBD added/VBD just/RB prior/JJ to/TO serving/VBG ./. It/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN better/JJR if/IN the/DT chicken/NN was/VBD freshly/RB fried/VBD ./. $/$ 6/CD A/DT good/JJ Chye/NNP Poh/NNP ommelette/NNP should/MD be/VB really/RB fluffy/JJ on/IN the/DT inside/JJ and/CC crisp/JJ on/IN the/DT outside/NN ./. To/PRP do/VB that/RB ,/, you/PRP need/VB skill/NN ,/, a/DT really/RB hot/JJ wok/NN and/CC hot/JJ oil/NN ./. The/DT one/CD was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC tasted/VBD like/IN something/NN you/PRP could/MD make/VB at/IN home/NN ./. Conclusion/NN Some/DT dishes/NNS were/VBD good/JJ ,/, some/JJ not/RB so/RB ,/, but/CC all/DT is/VBZ not/RB lost/JJ ./. This/DT place/NN is/VBZ opened/VBD till/NN 3am/NN daily/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ air-conditioned/JJ and/CC they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB charge/VB GST/NNP and/CC service/NN charge/NN ./. So/CC it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB a/DT great/JJ and/CC comfortable/JJ place/NN to/TO get/VB something/NN nice/JJ to/TO eat/VB in/IN and/CC warm/JJ the/DT tummy/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP working/VBG the/DT late/JJ night/NN shift/NN !/. -LRB-/NNP T2/NNP +/NNP V2/NNP +/NNP S2/NNP +/NNP E1/NNP -RRB-/NNP </text>
