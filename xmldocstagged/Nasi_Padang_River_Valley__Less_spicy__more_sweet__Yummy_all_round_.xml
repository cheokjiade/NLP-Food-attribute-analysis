<title>Nasi Padang River Valley: Less spicy, more sweet, Yummy all round!</title>
<text>If/IN you/PRP love/VBP Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ you/PRP would/MD have/VB at/IN least/RB heard/VBN of/IN Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP River/NNP Valley/NNP ./. This/DT place/NN is/VBZ probably/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/NN well/RB known/VBN places/NNS for/IN Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP in/IN Singapore/NNP and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB a/DT known/VBN fact/NN that/WDT one/CD of/IN their/PRP$ regular/NN customers/NN is/VBZ the/DT Sultan/NNP of/IN Brunei/NN who/WP would/MD tarpau/VB food/NN from/IN there/RB whenever/IN he/PRP is/VBZ in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. The/DT restaurant/NN started/VBD off/IN as/IN a/DT little/JJ stall/NN in/IN River/NNP Valley/NNP at/IN the/DT corner/NN of/IN Mohd/NNP Sultan/NNP Road/NNP in/IN 1957/NNP and/CC were/VBD infamous/NN for/IN its/PRP$ snaking/JJ long/JJ queues/NN ./. That/DT was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT reasons/NN they/PRP moved/VBD to/TO their/PRP$ present/JJ location/NN in/IN 1998/NN ./. The/DT 2nd/CD generation/NN owner/NN ,/, Zul/NN ,/, tells/VBZ me/PRP that/WDT he/PRP still/RB pretty/RB much/JJ does/VBZ most/RB of/IN the/DT cooking/NN which/WDT is/VBZ based/VBD on/IN his/PRP$ mother/NN 's/POS recipes/NN from/IN the/DT Bukit/JJ Tinggi/NN region/NN of/IN West/NN Sumatra/NN ./. But/CC do/VBP they/PRP serve/VBP authentic/JJ Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP ?/. By/CC his/PRP$ own/JJ admission/NN ,/, no/RB !/. Zul/DT tells/VBZ me/PRP that/WDT although/CC most/NN of/IN the/DT recipes/JJ have/VB their/PRP$ roots/NN in/IN Bukit/NN Tinggi/NN ,/, they/PRP have/VBP all/RB been/VBN modified/JJ to/TO suit/VB the/DT local/JJ tastebuds/NNS and/CC in/IN particular/JJ ,/, the/DT local/NNP Chinese/NNP palate/NN ./. So/RB that/IN means/NN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ generally/JJ milder/NN and/CC sweeter/NN instead/RB of/IN salty/NN and/CC spicy/JJ as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ back/RB home/NN ./. Bukit/JJ Tinggi/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT cities/NN within/IN the/DT province/NN of/IN West/NN Sumatra/NN which/WDT is/VBZ situated/RB in/IN the/DT highland/NN region/NN ./. As/IN such/JJ ,/, seafood/NN is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO obtain/NN ,/, unlike/NN Pariaman/NN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT coastal/JJ city/NN ./. So/RB although/RB they/PRP have/VBN a/DT few/JJ fish/NN dishes/NNS ,/, do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB to/TO find/VB fantastic/JJ Ikan/NN bakar/NN here/RB !/. The/DT one/CD thing/NN dish/NN that/WDT is/VBZ common/JJ amongst/NN the/DT Minangkabau/JJ people/NN -LRB-/NN inhabitants/NN of/IN West/NN Sumatra/NN -RRB-/NN is/VBZ Beef/NN Rendang/NN ./. Even/RB then/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ said/JJ that/WDT with/IN 2000/JJ provinces/NN in/IN Indonesia/NN ,/, there/RB is/VBZ probably/RB 2000/JJ different/JJ recipes/NN for/IN Beef/NN Rendang/NN ./. The/DT Beef/NN Rendang/NN here/RB would/MD probably/RB be/VB version/NN 2001/NN ./. As/IN I/PRP said/JJ earlier/NN ,/, the/DT taste/NN has/VBZ been/VBN tweaked/VBD to/TO suit/VB the/DT local/NNP Chinese/NNP palate/NN ,/, which/WRB explains/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP like/VB it/PRP so/RB much/JJ ./. The/DT meat/NN is/VBZ tender/JJ and/CC the/DT aroma/NN of/IN the/DT spices/NNS are/VBP distinct/JJ without/IN too/RB much/JJ heat/NN to/TO induce/VB sweat/NN !/. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD When/WRB I/PRP assess/VBD Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP ,/, I/PRP usually/RB ask/VB the/DT following/NN questions/NN :/: 1/CD ./. Do/VBP you/PRP grind/VB your/PRP$ own/JJ curry/NN powder/NN ?/. 2/CD ./. Do/VB you/PRP squeeze/NN your/PRP$ own/JJ coconut/NNP milk/NNP ?/. 3/CD ./. Are/DT you/PRP still/RB using/VBG mortar/NN and/CC pestle/NN ?/. Most/JJS of/IN the/DT good/JJ places/NNS say/VB yes/EX to/TO No./VB 1/CD and/CC I/PRP have/VBP never/RB come/VB across/IN anyone/PRP who/WP are/VBZ still/RB using/VBG mortar/NN and/CC pestle/NN to/TO pound/VB their/PRP$ rempah/NN ./. So/RB question/NN No./IN 2/CD is/VBZ a/DT very/RB important/JJ in/IN separating/VBG the/DT good/JJ from/IN the/DT great/JJ ./. In/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP River/NNP Valley/NNP ,/, I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ to/TO report/VB that/IN Zul/PRP still/RB squeezes/VBD coconut/NN milk/NN by/IN hand/NN daily/NN !/. He/PRP proudly/RB walked/VBD me/PRP into/IN his/PRP$ kitchen/NN to/TO show/VB me/PRP the/DT tubs/NN of/IN coconut/NN milk/NN in/IN the/DT fridge/NN which/WRB he/PRP squeezed/VBD in/IN the/DT morning/NN ./. On/JJ top/NN of/IN that/WDT ,/, Zul/PRP tells/VBZ me/PRP that/IN they/PRP only/RB use/VB fresh/JJ meats/NNS ,/, never/RB frozen/JJ which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB he/PRP is/VBZ not/RB apologetic/JJ about/IN his/PRP$ prices/NN being/VBG a/DT little/JJ on/IN the/DT higher/NN side/NN ./. Opor/JJ Ayam/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN those/DT special/JJ dishes/NNS which/WRB I/PRP can/MD distinctly/RB remember/VB my/PRP$ first/JJ time/NN eating/VBG it/PRP ./. I/PRP was/VBD pretty/RB young/JJ then/RB and/CC did/VBD n't/RB eat/VB spicy/JJ food/NN ./. So/RB whenever/NN curries/NNS were/VBD served/VBD at/IN home/NN ,/, mom/NN used/VBD to/TO have/VB to/TO wash/VB the/DT curry/NN chicken/NN wing/NN with/IN water/NN before/IN I/PRP would/MD eat/VB it/PRP ./. So/RB when/WRB Mom/VBZ brought/VBN me/PRP to/TO Rendesvous/VB Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP one/CD day/NN ,/, she/PRP ordered/VBD Opor/NN Ayam/NN for/IN me/PRP and/CC assured/VBD me/PRP that/WDT it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB spicy/JJ ./. I/PRP tell/VBP you/PRP ,/, I/PRP still/RB remember/VB that/IN taste/NN up/IN till/NN today/NN and/CC so/RB far/JJ ,/, I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB found/VBN any/RB place/NN that/WDT sells/VBZ Opor/JJ Ayam/NN with/IN that/DT exact/JJ same/JJ taste/NN !/. In/IN case/NN you/PRP were/VBD expecting/VBG me/PRP to/TO tell/VB you/PRP that/WDT I/PRP found/VBD that/IN taste/NN here/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP afraid/VBG you/PRP are/VBP in/IN for/IN an/DT anticlimax/NN ./. The/DT gravy/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ here/RB ,/, but/CC still/RB lacked/VB that/IN special/JJ something/NN which/WDT I/PRP remembered/VBD from/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ago/RB !/. 4.25/DT \//JJ 5/CD The/DT Egg/NN Omelette/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT Padang/JJ dish/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD something/NN Zul/NN 's/POS father/NN had/VBD come/VBN up/RP with/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ago/RB ./. Essentially/DT it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT frittata/NN or/CC a/DT thick/JJ omelet/NN with/IN onion/NN and/CC parsley/NN ./. But/CC unlike/NNP omelets/NNP in/IN the/DT west/NN where/WRB they/PRP take/VB pains/VB to/TO ensure/VB the/DT omelette/NN does/VBZ n't/RB turn/VB brown/JJ on/IN the/DT surface/NN ,/, the/DT omelet/NN here/RB is/VBZ cooked/VBN quickly/RB over/IN a/DT hot/JJ fire/NN so/IN that/WDT the/DT egg/NN turns/VBZ into/IN that/WDT familiar/JJ chewy/JJ stringy/JJ brown/JJ texture/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP showed/VBD it/PRP to/TO a/DT French/JJ Chef/NN ,/, he/PRP might/VB just/RB go/VB ``/JJ pppffff/NN !/. ''/RB ,/, but/CC hey/JJ ,/, I/PRP actually/RB enjoy/VB it/PRP this/DT way/NN as/IN I/PRP do/VBP the/DT deep/JJ fried/VBD egg/NN coating/NN on/IN a/DT bergedil/NN !/. I/PRP like/VB the/DT Sambal/NNP Sotong/NNP here/RB as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ more/RB sweet/JJ than/IN fiery/NN and/CC the/DT sotong/NN is/VBZ cooked/VBN to/TO perfection/VB with/IN a/DT nice/JJ tender/NN bite/VB ./. Just/RB a/DT little/JJ dissappointed/NN that/IN it/PRP did/VBD n't/RB have/VB that/IN creamy/JJ roe/NN inside/NN but/CC otherwise/VBD the/DT sambal/NN is/VBZ sweet/JJ complement/VB to/TO the/DT other/JJ more/NN savoury/NN curries/NNS ./. 4.25/DT \//JJ 5/CD Conclusion/NN I/PRP guess/VB Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP purists/NN might/VB complain/VB that/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ too/RB sweet/JJ and/CC not/RB spicy/JJ enough/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP am/VBP always/RB very/RB happy/JJ whenever/IN I/PRP eat/VBP there/RB ./. The/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ and/CC the/DT family/NN still/RB prepares/VBZ so/RB meticulously/JJ that/IN they/PRP still/RB squeeze/NN their/PRP$ coconut/NNP milk/NNP !/. The/DT main/JJ complaint/NN I/PRP always/RB hear/NN is/VBZ about/IN the/DT prices/NN being/NN on/IN the/DT high/JJ side/NN ,/, but/CC judging/RB from/IN the/DT crowds/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB that/DT stopped/NN them/PRP from/IN coming/NN back/RB again/RB and/CC again/RB !/. Note/NNP :/: They/PRP will/VB be/VB opened/VBD on/IN the/DT first/JJ two/CD days/NNS of/IN Chinese/NNP New/NNP Year/NNP !/. -LRB-/NNP 23-24/NNP Jan/NNP -RRB-/NNP Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP River/NNP Valley/NNP 54/NNP Zion/NNP Road/NNP Singapore/NNP 247779/NNP 67343383/NNP 10am/NN to/TO 8.30/VB pm/JJ Closed/NN Mon/NN and/CC PH/NN </text>
