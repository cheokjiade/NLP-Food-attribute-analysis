<title>Saturday Nite Steamboat Fever</title>
<text>I/PRP have/VBP never/RB been/VBN a/DT steamboat/NN person/NN ./. Dunking/RB a/DT piece/NN of/IN meat/NN in/IN chicken/NN soup/NN just/RB does/VBZ n't/RB turn/VB me/PRP on/IN ./. For/INs me/PRP ,/, meat/NN has/VBZ got/VBN to/TO be/VB grilled/VBN ,/, fried/JJ or/CC deep/JJ fried/VBD with/IN a/DT nice/JJ marinade/NN ./. How/WRB tasty/JJ can/NN a/DT piece/NN of/IN boiled/NN meat/NN be/VB ?/. All/PDT that/WDT changed/JJ when/WRB I/PRP had/VBD my/PRP$ first/JJ beef/NN shabu/NN shabu/NN at/IN the/DT beginning/VBG of/IN the/DT year/NN ./. Aside/RB from/IN having/VBG thin/JJ slices/NNS of/IN tender/NN ,/, melt/NN in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN beef/NN ,/, you/PRP also/RB get/VB a/DT rich/JJ broth/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN to/TO enjoy/VB ./. I/PRP started/VBD to/TO appreciate/VB steamboats/NN more/NN ./. My/PRP$ wife/JJ insists/NN that/WDT its/PRP$ because/IN I/PRP am/VBP getting/VBG old/JJ ./. But/CC from/IN the/DT looks/VBZ of/IN it/PRP ,/, steamboats/NNS are/VBP n't/RB just/RB for/IN the/DT old/JJ ./. The/DT restaurants/NN that/IN line/JJ the/DT streets/NN between/IN Beach/NNP Road/NNP and/CC Bugis/NNS are/VBP teeming/VBN with/IN teenagers/NN and/CC older/NN folks/NN alike/NN ./. There/EX must/MD have/VB been/VBN more/JJR than/IN 10/CD such/NN steamboat/NN restaurants/NN ./. Hmmm/JJ ,/, am/VBZ I/PRP missing/VB something/NN here/RB ?/. So/RB after/IN dropping/VBG the/DT family/NN and/CC spending/NN half/IN an/DT hour/NN looking/VBG for/IN parking/JJ lot/NN ,/, we/PRP settled/VB down/VB for/IN -LRB-/IN my/PRP$ first/JJ -RRB-/NN mala/NN steamboat/NN ./. I/PRP think/VB that/WDT 's/POS steamboat/NN with/IN the/DT fiery/JJ chilli/NN padi/NN soup/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD more/JJ interested/NNS in/IN the/DT thinly/RB sliced/VBN meats/NNS and/CC was/VBD glad/JJ to/TO find/VB that/IN various/NN members/NN of/IN the/DT animal/NN kingdom/NN were/VBD aptly/RB represented/JJ ./. Thin/DT sliced/VBN streaky/NN beef/NN ,/, mutton/NN ,/, pork/NN and/CC chicken/NN ./. Yes/EX ,/, this/PRP looks/VBZ promising/NN ./. There/EX was/VBD also/RB the/DT usual/JJ selection/NN of/IN seafood/NN ,/, vegetables/NNS ,/, tofu/NN and/CC processed/NN meats/NNS in/IN all/DT different/JJ shapes/NN and/CC form/NN ./. What/WP impressed/VBD me/PRP most/RB was/VBD the/DT wide/NN variety/NN of/IN sauces/NNS available/JJ !/. Satay/NN ,/, sesame/NN ,/, peanut/NN ,/, soy/NN ,/, vinegar/NN ,/, chinchalok/NN ,/, chilli/NN ,/, sambal/NN ,/, the/DT list/NN goes/VBZ on/IN ./. I/PRP found/VBD that/IN the/DT combination/NN of/IN sesame/NN and/CC satay/NN sauce/NN was/VBD heavenly/RB with/IN the/DT sliced/VBN meats/NNS ./. The/DT fiery/NN cilli/NN padi/NN based/VBD soup/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ too/RB painful/JJ for/IN me/PRP ./. Problem/DT is/VBZ that/WDT I/PRP start/VB sweating/VB and/CC scratching/VB my/PRP$ head/NN and/CC pretty/RB much/JJ give/JJ up/NN before/IN my/PRP$ endorphins/NNS are/VBP released/JJ ./. So/CC I/PRP never/RB get/VB too/RB far/JJ with/IN spicy/JJ stuff/NN to/TO enjoy/VB the/DT rush/NN ./. For/IN $/$ 15/CD ,/, everyone/PRP had/VBD a/DT good/JJ feed/VB except/IN the/DT kids/NNS -LRB-/IN $/$ 8/CD -/: no/RB wonder/VB there/EX are/VBP so/RB few/JJ children/NNS around/IN -RRB-/JJ Certainly/NN worth/NN coming/NN back/RB again/RB with/IN a/DT few/JJ good/JJ makankakis/NNP ./. -LRB-/DT Just/JJ to/TO watch/VB them/PRP eat/VB !/. -RRB-/PRP$ After/JJ about/IN 2/CD hours/NNS ,/, the/DT shelling/NN stopped/NN ,/, -LRB-/. The/DT table/NN was/VBD chock/RB full/JJ of/IN crab/NN shell/NN ,/, prawn/NN shells/NN ,/, clam/NN shell/NN ,/, egg/NN shells/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC we/PRP decided/VBD that/IN we/PRP must/MD have/VB gotten/VBN our/JJ $/$ 15/CD worth/NN of/IN food/NN -LRB-/IN I/PRP must/MD have/VB eaten/VBN 1.5/CD kg/NN meat/NN ,/, crab/NN and/CC prawns/NNS -/: I/PRP figured/VBD the/DT average/NN price/NN of/IN $/$ 10\/kg/CD meat/NN should/MD be/VB about/IN right/NN -RRB-/NN ./. We/PRP were/VBD so/RB stuffed/JJ that/IN we/PRP decided/VBD take/VB the/DT longer/RB route/JJ to/TO the/DT car/NN and/CC check/VB out/IN the/DT other/JJ eateries/NNS along/IN Liang/NNP Seah/NNP Street/NNP ./. I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB been/VB down/RB here/RB in/IN a/DT while/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP was/VBD amazed/JJ to/TO see/VB how/RB many/JJ new/JJ eateries/NNS have/VBP sprung/VBN up/RP ./. Hello/JJ !/. What/WP is/VBZ this/DT ?/. Hong/NNP Kong/NNP desert/NN shop/NN ?/. Hmmm/DT interesting/JJ ,/, but/CC we/PRP are/VBP so/RB full/JJ !/. The/DT signage/NN says/VBZ :/: Ji/NNP De/NNP Chi/NNP -LRB-/NNP Do/VBP n't/RB forget/VBP to/TO eat/VB -RRB-/NN ./. Our/PRP$ stomachs/JJ said/JJ no/RB ,/, but/CC like/IN sotongs/NNP -LRB-/NNP squids/NNP -RRB-/NNP we/PRP were/VBD drawn/VBN to/TO the/DT light/JJ ./. Wow/NN ,/, so/RB many/JJ interesting/JJ deserts/NN !/. Ah/NN ,/, just/RB look/VB look/VB and/CC see/VB see/VB ./. It/PRP was/VBD packed/VBN and/CC there/RB were/VBD no/RB seats/NNS anywhere/RB ./. Just/JJ as/IN well/RB ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD ,/, we/PRP ca/MD n't/RB possibly/VB eat/VB anymore/RB ./. Just/RB then/RB ,/, a/DT nice/JJ couple/NN got/VBD off/IN the/DT table/NN just/RB next/JJ to/TO me/PRP ./. What/WP the/DT heck/NN ?/. It/PRP was/VBD my/PRP$ destiny/NN ./. So/CC we/PRP ordered/VBD a/DT few/JJ different/JJ things/NNS to/TO try/VB ./. It/PRP was/VBD very/RB good/JJ but/CC I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN the/DT desert/NN shops/NN that/WDT sell/VB this/DT types/NN of/IN deserts/NN in/IN the/DT hawker/NN centres/NNS are/VBP comparable/VBN in/IN taste/NN ./. However/RB ,/, the/DT atmosphere/NN makes/VBZ all/RB the/DT difference/NN ./. James/PRP had/VBD the/DT mango/NN with/IN grapefruit/JJ juice/NN which/WDT was/VBD very/RB refreshing/VBG ./. We/PRP also/RB sampled/VBD the/DT herbal/NN jelly/NN ,/, glutinous/JJ rice/NN balls/NNS in/IN ginger/NN soup/NN and/CC sesame\/almond/NN paste/NN ./. Great/JJ way/NN to/TO end/VB a/DT great/JJ evening/NN ./. Eno/MD before/RB bed/VB ,/, tommorrow/IN I/PRP diet/NN ./. Ji/NNP De/NNP Chi/. 8/CD Liang/NNP Seah/NNP Street/NNP ,/, #/SYM 01-03/CD 11am-11pm/NNS closed/VBD on/IN Mondays/NNP </text>
