<title>First Time in a Taiwanese Restaurant</title>
<text>Today/. I/PRP decided/VBD that/IN I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO try/VB something/NN new/JJ ./. Before/IN today/NN ,/, the/DT only/JJ Taiwanese/NN cuisine/NN I/PRP had/VBD before/RB was/VBD crispy/JJ chicken/NN and/CC chicken/NN floss/NN crepe/NN at/IN the/DT Shinlin/NN outlets/NN ./. I/PRP never/RB really/RB thought/VBD much/RB of/IN Taiwanese/NN cuisine/NN ,/, but/CC lately/CC it/PRP is/VBZ becoming/RB more/JJ popular/JJ in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, so/RB I/PRP thought/VBD any/RB self/JJ respecting/NN foodie/NN should/VBD at/IN least/RB give/VB it/PRP a/DT go/VB ./. The/DT restaurant/NN manager/NN seemed/NN quite/RB passionate/JJ about/IN his/PRP$ craft/NN and/CC insists/NN that/WDT all/PDT the/DT ingredients/NNS used/VBD have/VBN been/VBN specially/RB imported/VBN from/IN Taiwan/NN ,/, so/RB that/WDT we/PRP get/VB to/TO eat/VB authentic/JJ Taiwanese/NN food/NN ./. That/DT 's/POS always/RB a/DT good/JJ sign/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD expecting/VBG something/NN akin/NN to/TO blue/JJ cheese/NN ,/, but/CC surprisingly/NNP Chou/NNP Dou/NNP Fu/NNP is/VBZ n't/RB so/RB smelly/JJ after/IN all/DT ./. I/PRP guess/VB its/PRP$ ok/NN ./. Nice/JJ and/CC crispy/JJ on/IN the/DT outside/NN ./. The/DT bean/NN curd/NN tastes/VBZ quite/RB savoury/JJ and/CC goes/VBZ well/RB with/IN the/DT chilli/NN ./. Good/JJ but/CC unremarkable/JJ ./. Noodles/PRP were/VBD nice/JJ and/CC Al/JJ Dente/NN ./. Sauce/PRP was/VBD nice/JJ too/RB ./. But/CC for/IN me/PRP it/PRP still/RB lacks/VBZ the/DT ``/NN When/WRB am/VBZ I/PRP coming/VBP back/RB again/RB ?/. ''/RB feeling/VBG ./. Good/JJ but/CC unremarkable/JJ Now/JJ things/NNS are/VBP starting/VBG to/TO look/VB better/NN ./. The/DT pancakes/NN here/RB are/VBP definately/JJ better/NN then/RB the/DT ones/NNS I/PRP had/VBD before/RB ./. They/PRP use/VB a/DT nice/JJ soft/JJ batter/NN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ more/NN on/IN the/DT chewy/JJ side/NN ,/, so/RB you/PRP can/MD really/RB sink/VB you/PRP teeth/VB into/IN it/PRP ./. Definitely/PRP can/MD try/VB again/RB ./. I/PRP like/VB this/DT soup/NN ./. The/DT pork/NN ribs/NNS are/VBP first/JJ deep/JJ fried/JJ and/CC then/RB simmered/VBD in/IN the/DT soup/NN ./. This/DT gave/VBD the/DT soup/NN a/DT real/JJ unique/NN taste/NN which/WDT is/VBZ really/RB quite/RB novel/JJ for/IN me/PRP ./. Definitely/PRP can/MD try/VB again/RB ./. I/PRP had/VBD high/JJ hopes/NN for/IN this/DT icon/NN of/IN Taiwanese/NNP Xiao/NNP Chi/NNP -LRB-/NNP Small/NNP Eats/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. Having/VBG tried/VBD the/DT Shilin/NN version/NN before/IN ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD this/DT would/MD be/VB the/DT benchmark/NN for/IN them/PRP ./. Unlike/NNP Shilin/NNP ,/, they/PRP use/VB chicken/NN thigh/NNS mean/VB and/CC it/PRP comes/VBZ out/RP in/IN cubes/NN ./. I/PRP guess/VB if/IN this/DT is/VBZ as/RB good/JJ as/IN crispy/JJ spiced/JJ chicken/NN gets/NNS ,/, then/RB I/PRP would/MD rather/RB have/VB Chicken/NN Karaage/NN anyday/RB ./. Do/VBP n't/RB get/VB me/PRP wrong/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, not/RB as/IN good/JJ as/IN the/DT Shilin/NN version/NN but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ really/RB crispy/JJ on/IN the/DT outside/NN and/CC juicy/NN on/IN the/DT inside/NN ./. Its/PRP just/RB that/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB much/RB about/IN the/DT spices/NNS ./. If/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT most/JJ authentic/JJ Taiwanese/NN Restaurant/NN in/IN town/NN as/IN claimed/JJ by/IN the/DT restaurant/NN manager/NN ,/, then/RB I/PRP am/VBP not/RB crazy/JJ about/IN Taiwanese/JJ food/NN ./. For/IN Japanese/NN food/NN ,/, at/IN least/RB I/PRP dream/VB about/IN having/VBG Kobe/NN beef/NN in/IN Japan/NNP ./. For/IN Thai/JJ food/NN ,/, I/PRP dream/VB about/IN having/VBG Sticky/NNP Rice/NNP and/CC Fried/NNP Chicken/NNP in/IN Bangkok/NNP ./. But/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB dream/VB about/IN eating/VBG anything/NN in/IN Taiwan/NN ./. The/DT food/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ./. There/EX is/VBZ just/RB nothing/NN that/WDT would/MD pull/VB me/PRP back/RB to/TO eat/VB here/RB again/RB anytime/JJ soon/NN ./. Peng/JJ Lai/NN Ge/NN is/VBZ situated/JJ at/IN 456/NNP Joo/NNP Chiat/NNP Road/NNP ./. Tel/JJ 64781787/NN ./. They/PRP are/VBP opened/VBD from/IN 11am/NN to/TO 10pm/VB ./. </text>
