<title>Quoted in Today Paper: Native American Food</title>
<text>Has/. anyone/PRP else/RB tried/VBD native/NN American/NN food/NN ?/. I/PRP certainly/RB have/VBP n't/RB ./. Would/MD n't/RB mind/VB trying/VBG a/DT Bison/JJ ribeye/NN steak/NN with/IN blue/JJ corn/NN though/IN ./. So/RB do/VB you/PRP all/RB agree/VB with/IN me/PRP that/WDT Singaporeans/NNS are/VBP willing/JJ to/TO give/VB new/JJ foods/NN a/DT go/VB as/IN long/JJ as/IN there/RB is/VBZ a/DT common/JJ point/NN of/IN reference/NN ?/. By/CC that/WDT I/PRP mean/VB that/WDT when/WRB you/PRP eat/VB Bison/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD relate/VB to/TO it/PRP because/IN you/PRP think/VB of/IN it/PRP as/IN another/DT form/NN of/IN beef/NN ./. But/CC if/IN you/PRP were/VBD presented/VBD with/IN ,/, say/VB Widgety/JJ Grubs/NN ,/, you/PRP might/VB not/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO stomach/NN it/PRP since/IN you/PRP would/MD have/VB a/DT difficult/JJ time/NN trying/VBG to/TO liken/VB it/PRP to/TO something/NN else/RB ./. I/PRP think/VB that/WDT 's/POS the/DT problem/NN with/IN Ang/JJ Mohs/NN and/CC Durians/NNPS ./. The/DT smell/NN and/CC taste/NN of/IN Durian/NNP is/VBZ so/RB unique/JJ that/IN they/PRP find/VBP it/PRP difficult/JJ to/TO have/VB a/DT point/NN of/IN reference/NN to/TO something/NN they/PRP are/VBP familiar/JJ with/IN ./. And/CC when/WRB the/DT closest/JJS thing/NN they/PRP can/MD think/VB of/IN is/VBZ smelly/JJ socks/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/POS no/RB wonder/VB they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB enjoy/VB it/PRP !/. </text>
