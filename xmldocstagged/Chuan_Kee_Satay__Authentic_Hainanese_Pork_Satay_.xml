<title>Chuan Kee Satay: Authentic Hainanese Pork Satay!</title>
<text>After/JJ over/IN a/DT year/NN of/IN blogging/VBG ,/, I/PRP must/MD admit/VB that/IN I/PRP am/VBP getting/VBG a/DT little/JJ spoilt/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ getting/VBG harder/NN and/CC harder/NN to/TO find/VB dishes/NNS that/WDT really/RB make/VB me/PRP go/VB ``/VB Phwa/VB Say/VB !!/RB ''/. I/PRP guess/VB the/DT threshold/NN to/TO delight/VB keeps/VBZ getting/VBG higher/NN and/CC higher/NN because/IN once/RB you/PRP have/VBP tested/VBN the/DT best/JJ ,/, the/DT rest/NN just/RB do/VBP n't/RB thrill/VB anymore/RB ./. Fortunately/JJ ,/, there/RB are/VBP still/RB many/JJ gems/NNS out/IN there/RB just/RB waiting/VBG to/TO be/VB found/VBD ./. And/CC finding/RB this/DT satay/NN was/VBD a/DT ``/NNP Holy/NNP Grail/NP ''/JJ experience/NN after/IN quite/RB a/DT long/JJ lull/NN period/NN ./. The/DT elderly/NN couple/NN manning/VBZ this/DT stall/NN told/VBD me/PRP that/IN they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN dishing/VBG out/IN their/PRP$ satay/NN for/IN almost/RB 50/CD years/NNS ./. The/DT uncle/NN started/VBD out/IN by/IN helping/VBG his/PRP father/NN sell/VB satay/NN when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD just/RB 5/CD years/NNS old/RB along/IN the/DT streets/NN of/IN Geylang/NN ./. Back/RB then/RB ,/, satays/NNS were/VBD 5/CD cents/NN per/NN stick/NN and/CC they/PRP were/VBD not/RB as/IN popular/JJ as/IN they/PRP are/VBP now/RB ./. This/DT is/VBZ traditional/JJ Hainanese/NNP style/NN satay/NN which/WRB means/VBZ Pork/NNP Satay/NN served/VBD with/IN a/DT peanut/JJ gravy/NN that/WDT comes/VBZ with/IN a/DT pineapple/JJ slush/NN ./. The/DT flowery/NN bouquet/NN from/IN the/DT freshly/JJ grilled/VBN skewers/NN was/VBD too/RB much/JJ of/IN an/DT unbearable/JJ tease/NN and/CC the/DT first/JJ bite/VB of/IN the/DT satay/NN was/VBD like/IN getting/VBG infatuated/IN all/DT over/IN again/RB ./. The/DT meat/NN is/VBZ really/RB tender/JJ and/CC coated/VBN with/IN spicy/JJ golden/NN syrup/NN that/IN hinted/NN strongly/NN of/IN lemongrass/NN and/CC coriander/NN ./. Fantastic/JJ ./. I/PRP remembered/VBD as/IN a/DT kid/NN ,/, pork/NN satay/NN used/VBD to/TO come/VB in/IN 5/CD sections/NN ./. Meat/NNP ,/, fat/NN ,/, meat/NN ,/, fat/NN ,/, meat/NN ./. This/DT one/CD only/RB had/VBD 3/CD sections/NNS ./. Meat/NNP ,/, fat/NN ,/, meat/NN ./. I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP might/VB be/VB because/IN they/PRP cut/VB down/VB on/IN the/DT fat/NN because/IN of/IN health/NN concerns/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT uncle/NN told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT this/DT is/VBZ the/DT ``/JJ pattern/NN ''/NN that/IN they/PRP have/VBP kept/VBN for/IN as/IN long/JJ as/IN he/PRP can/MD remember/VB ./. Ok/JJ ,/, the/DT fat/NN makes/VBZ the/DT satay/NN really/RB juicy/JJ and/CC delicious/JJ but/CC do/VB remember/VB to/TO always/RB eat/VB in/IN moderation/NNP ok/NNP ?/. Heavenly/JJ pork/NN satay/NN ./. I/PRP must/VB admit/VB that/WDT I/PRP have/VBN not/RB eaten/VBD such/JJ tasty/JJ Pork/NNP Satay/NN ,/, at/IN least/RB not/RB for/IN a/DT very/RB long/JJ time/NN ./. Now/RB before/IN I/PRP get/VB carried/VB away/RB ,/, I/PRP must/MD warn/VB you/PRP that/WDT the/DT waiting/VBG time/NN on/IN the/DT weekend/NN is/VBZ around/RB 45/JJ minutes/NN and/CC while/NN I/PRP was/VBD queuing/JJ ,/, a/DT young/JJ lady/NN was/VBD bitterly/RB complaining/JJ that/IN the/DT chicken/NN satay/NN she/PRP just/RB had/VBD was/VBD not/RB worth/JJ the/DT wait/NN ./. OK/JJ ,/, so/IN I/PRP am/VBP only/RB vouching/VB for/IN the/DT Pork/NNP Satay/NN not/RB the/DT chicken/NN ./. My/PRP$ advice/NN is/VBZ to/TO head/NN straight/NN for/IN the/DT stall/NN ,/, order/NN your/PRP$ satay/NN and/CC go/VB eat/VB other/JJ stuff/NN while/IN you/PRP wait/VBP ./. And/CC make/VB sure/VB you/PRP order/VB more/JJR than/IN enough/JJ ./. It/PRP was/VBD so/RB good/JJ ,/, I/PRP came/VBD back/RB to/TO reorder/VB some/DT more/NN and/CC that/WDT meant/NN more/NN waiting/VBG !/. </text>
