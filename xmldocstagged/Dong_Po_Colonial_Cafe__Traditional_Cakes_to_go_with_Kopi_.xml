<title>Dong Po Colonial Cafe: Traditional Cakes to go with Kopi!</title>
<text>Singapore/NNP 's/POS very/RB own/JJ coffee/NN culture/NN has/VBZ come/VBN a/DT long/JJ way/NN since/IN Ya/NNP Kun/NNP started/VBD the/DT ball/NN rolling/NN by/IN ushering/NN in/IN the/DT concept/NN of/IN Kopi/NN Cafes/NN in/IN the/DT 90/CD 's/POS ./. Before/IN that/WDT ,/, Singaporeans/NNS were/VBD only/RB able/JJ to/TO enjoy/VB Kopi/NN and/CC Kaya/NN Toast/NN at/IN individual/NN kopitiams/NN ./. So/RB if/IN you/PRP wanted/VBD Ya/NN Kun/NN 's/POS kopi/NN you/PRP had/VBD to/TO head/NN to/TO Lao/VB Pa/NN Sat/NN and/CC if/IN you/PRP felt/VBD like/IN Killiney/NNP 's/POS ,/, then/RB you/PRP headed/JJ for/IN the/DT old/JJ shophouse/NN along/IN Killiney/NN road/NN ./. Nowadays/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT given/VBN that/IN you/PRP can/MD enjoy/VB a/DT cup/NN of/IN Kopi/NN at/IN any/RB shopping/VBG center/NN ./. And/CC even/RB around/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, where/RB ever/RB you/PRP find/VB a/DT Capitalland/NNP Mall/NNP ,/, you/PRP would/MD invariably/RB find/VB a/DT Toastbox/NN selling/VBG Nanyang/NN style/NN kopi/NN and/CC kaya/NN toast/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD Toastbox/RB -LRB-/. I/PRP think/VB -RRB-/VB that/WDT started/VBD the/DT revolution/NN of/IN buttercream/NN cakes/NNS although/CC Polar/NNP Cafe/NNP had/VBD been/VBN selling/VBG their/PRP$ sugar/NN rolls/NN for/IN quite/RB a/DT while/NN now/RB ./. While/DT there/EX are/VBP now/RB many/JJ Kopi/NN Cafes/NN around/IN at/IN the/DT moment/NN ,/, most/NN of/IN them/PRP are/VBP still/RB focusing/JJ on/IN Kaya/NN Toast/NN ./. I/PRP believe/VB the/DT next/JJ trend/NN in/IN our/JJ Kopi/NN Culture/NN is/VBZ the/DT re-emergence/NN of/IN our/PRP$ traditional/JJ cakes/NNS and/CC confectioneries/NN which/WDT we/PRP Gen/NNP Xers/NNP and/CC Baby/NNP Boomers/NNP have/VBZ enjoyed/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ childhood/JJ years/NNS ./. Leading/IN the/DT way/NN in/IN this/DT trend/NN is/VBZ Kelvin/JJ Soh/NN ,/, a/DT 4th/JJ generation/NN baker/NN who/WP started/VBD Dong/VBG Po/NNP Colonial/NNP Cafe/NNP earlier/NNP this/DT year/NN to/TO fulfill/VB his/PRP$ father/NN 's/POS dream/NN of/IN keeping/VBG the/DT decades/JJ old/JJ family/NN recipes/NN alive/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD Kelvin/JJ 's/POS great/JJ grand/NN uncle/NN ,/, a/DT Hainanese/NNP baker/NNP who/WP first/JJ learn/IN the/DT art/NN of/IN French/NN pastry/NN when/WRB he/PRP apprenticed/VBD at/IN the/DT now/RB defunct/JJ GH/NNP Cafe/NNP ./. In/IN it/PRP 's/POS heydays/NN in/IN the/DT 60/CD 's/POS ,/, GH/NNP Cafe/NNP was/VBD an/DT upper/JJ class/NN establishment/NN located/VBD along/IN Battery/NNP Road/NNP which/WDT catered/VBD to/TO the/DT European/JJ families/NN living/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. Both/NNP GH/NNP and/CC Polar/NNP Cafe/NNP along/IN High/NNP Street/NNP provided/VBD Singaporeans/NNS a/DT peek/NN into/IN European/JJ culture/NN and/CC was/VBD accessible/RB only/RB to/TO the/DT upper/JJ crust/NN of/IN our/PRP$ society/NN ./. Kelvin/DT 's/POS Great/JJ Grand/NN Uncle/NN subsequently/RB went/VBD on/IN to/TO open/VB his/PRP$ own/JJ coffeeshop/NN along/IN Killiney/NNP Road/NNP where/WRB there/RB was/VBD a/DT large/JJ Hainanese/NNP community/NN and/CC roped/NN in/IN his/PRP$ grandfather/NN to/TO help/VB out/IN ./. It/PRP was/VBD at/IN this/DT coffeeshop/NN that/IN Kelvin/NN 's/POS father/NN ,/, Albert/RB Soh/RB developed/VBN his/PRP$ passion/NN for/IN baking/NN ./. Albert/PRP went/VBD on/IN to/TO study/VB at/IN Le/NNP Cordon/NNP Bleu/NNP and/CC worked/VBD as/IN a/DT pastry/NN chef/NN around/IN the/DT world/NN before/IN coming/NN home/NN to/TO Singapore/NNP to/TO open/VB La/NN Maison/NN along/IN Sixth/NNP Ave/NNP in/IN the/DT 90/CD 's/POS where/WRB he/PRP worked/VBD till/IN his/PRP$ retirement/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD during/IN those/DT quiet/JJ retirement/NN years/NNS that/IN Albert/NN dreamed/NN about/IN resurrecting/VBG the/DT age/JJ old/JJ family/NN recipes/NN for/IN a/DT new/JJ generation/NN of/IN Singaporeans/NNS to/TO enjoy/VB ./. Enter/VB his/PRP$ son/NN ,/, Kelvin/RB who/WP decided/VBD to/TO give/VB up/IN his/PRP$ job/NN as/IN a/DT graphic/JJ designer/NN to/TO carry/VB on/IN the/DT family/NN tradition/NN ./. And/CC so/RB Dong/JJ Po/NNP Colonial/NNP Cafe/NNP was/VBD born/VBD ./. For/IN Gen/NNP Xers/NNP like/IN myself/PRP ,/, walking/VBG into/IN Dong/JJ Po/NN is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ blast/NN from/IN the/DT past/IN ./. When/WRB I/PRP was/VBD growing/JJ up/NN ,/, the/DT very/RB first/JJ cake/NN that/WDT I/PRP ever/RB remember/VB eating/VBG was/VBD my/PRP$ mom/NN 's/VBZ orange/JJ butter/NN cake/NN ./. Even/RB today/JJ ,/, my/PRP$ mom-in-law/NN keeps/VBZ insisting/VBD that/IN her/PRP favorite/JJ cake/NN is/VBZ the/DT orange/JJ butter/NN cake/NN whenever/NN we/PRP cut/VB her/PRP birthday/JJ cake/NN which/WDT is/VBZ invariably/RB one/CD of/IN those/DT sponge/JJ cakes/NNS made/VBD with/IN fresh/JJ cream/NN ./. I/PRP plan/VBD to/TO bring/VB her/PRP to/TO the/DT Cafe/NNP soon/NN so/IN that/WDT I/PRP can/MD seal/VB my/PRP$ pole/NN position/NN as/IN favorite/JJ son-in-law/NN !/. Muah/NNP Ha/NNP Ha/NNP Ha/NNP Ha/NNP !/. Yeah/JJ ,/, that/WDT kind/NN of/IN evil/NN laugh/NN is/VBZ also/RB a/DT blast/NN from/IN my/PRP$ childhood/NN past/IN ./. Nowadays/RB those/DT evil/JJ masterminds/NN who/WP want/VB to/TO take/VB over/IN the/DT world/NN just/RB chuckle/RB ./. But/CC I/PRP digress/VBP .../: According/VBG to/TO Sylvia/VB Tan/NN ,/, these/DT Butter/JJ Cakes/NNS are/VBP probably/RB the/DT first/JJ Western/NN Cakes/NN to/TO be/VB baked/VBD in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. -LRB-/JJ Singapore/NNP Heritage/NNP Food/NNP -RRB-/NNP Kelvin/NNP told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT it/PRP was/VBD our/JJ local/NN bakers/NN who/WP made/VBD them/PRP into/IN these/DT cylindrical/JJ shapes/NN so/RB that/IN they/PRP can/MD be/VB dunked/NN into/IN kopi/NN ./. They/PRP used/VBD to/TO fashion/NN their/PRP$ baking/JJ trays/NN from/IN sawn/JJ off/IN piping/VBG in/IN order/NN to/TO produce/VB the/DT cylindrical/JJ shape/NN ./. Even/RB now/RB when/WRB they/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO resurrect/VB this/DT recipe/NN ,/, they/PRP had/VBD to/TO fashion/NN their/PRP$ own/JJ trays/NN by/IN getting/VBG someone/NN to/TO custom/VB make/VB it/PRP for/IN them/PRP !/. The/DT butter/NN cake/NN was/VBD a/DT perfect/JJ complement/VB to/TO the/DT thick/JJ ,/, bitter/JJ ,/, treacle/NN like/IN Kopi/NN which/WDT we/PRP used/VBD to/TO enjoy/VB in/IN the/DT past/IN ./. The/DT butter/NN from/IN the/DT cake/JJ melts/NN when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ dunked/JJ into/IN the/DT coffee/NN and/CC adds/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ buttery/JJ aroma/NN and/CC a/DT smooth/JJ body/NN to/TO the/DT brew/NN ./. For/IN those/RB who/WP can/MD remember/VB ,/, those/RB were/VBD the/DT days/NNS when/WRB it/PRP was/VBD very/RB fashionable/JJ to/TO melt/VB a/DT piece/NN of/IN butter/NN in/IN the/DT kopi/NN and/CC drink/VB it/PRP up/RB !/. I/PRP know/VB that/IN the/DT good/JJ people/NN at/IN HPB/PRP are/VBP having/VBG a/DT heart/NN attack/NN reading/NN this/DT !/. Aside/RB from/IN the/DT butter/NN cake/NN ,/, the/DT cafe/NN also/RB bakes/VBZ a/DT range/NN of/IN other/JJ very/RB nostalgic/JJ confectioneries/NN ./. The/DT Bostock/NN is/VBZ another/DT good/JJ example/NN of/IN how/RB our/JJ bakers/NN modified/IN their/PRP$ recipes/NN to/TO suit/VB the/DT local/JJ taste/NN ./. Bostock/DT is/VBZ usually/RB made/VBD with/IN brioche/NN ,/, but/CC Kelvin/NNP 's/POS grandad/NN modified/IN it/PRP by/IN using/VBG local/NNP bread/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ baked/VBD fresh/JJ at/IN the/DT cafe/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ slathered/JJ with/IN frangipane/JJ -LRB-/NN an/DT almond/NN ,/, sugar/NN ,/, butter/NN and/CC flour/NN mixture/NN -RRB-/NN ,/, topped/VBD with/IN sliced/VBN Almonds/NN and/CC dusted/NN with/IN icing/NN sugar/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ not/RB very/RB common/JJ and/CC certainly/RB a/DT must/VB try/VB when/WRB you/PRP visit/VB !/. It/PRP is/VBZ made/VBD to/TO order/NN ,/, so/RB be/VB prepared/VBD to/TO wait/VB for/IN a/DT while/NN for/IN it/PRP ./. Before/IN the/DT current/JJ macaron/NN craze/VB -/: we/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG way/NN ,/, way/NN before/IN ,/, Singaporeans/NNS were/VBD already/RB enjoying/VBG Macaron/NN Tarts/NN ./. The/DT top/NN is/VBZ essentially/RB the/DT meringue/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP all/RB familiar/JJ with/IN but/CC it/PRP sits/VBZ on/IN top/NN of/IN a/DT layer/NN of/IN almond/NN cake/NN and/CC over/RB a/DT buttery/JJ tart/NN base/NN ./. Good/JJ Almond/NN Macaron/NN Tarts/NNS are/VBP hard/JJ to/TO make/VB and/CC the/DT sign/NN of/IN a/DT good/JJ tart/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ hollow/JJ inside/NN !/. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP have/VBP come/VBN across/IN these/DT but/CC I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ there/EX are/VBP readers/NNS out/IN there/RB who/WP remember/VB eating/VBG them/PRP !/. I/PRP used/VBD to/TO enjoy/VB lamingtons/RB when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD living/VBN in/IN Australia/NNP but/CC they/PRP were/VBD of/IN the/DT chocolate/NN variety/NN ./. These/DT are/VBP the/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP am/VBP seeing/VBG them/PRP in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. According/VBG to/TO Kelvin/NN ,/, these/DT were/VBD also/RB popular/JJ in/IN the/DT past/IN ,/, but/CC for/IN some/DT reason/NN ,/, they/PRP disappeared/VBP from/IN the/DT scene/NN ./. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB even/RB remember/VB seeing/VBG them/PRP as/IN a/DT kid/NN !/. Dong/DT Po/NN also/RB make/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ jams/NN to/TO go/VB with/IN their/PRP$ freshly/JJ baked/VBD scones/NNS ./. I/PRP was/VBD happy/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN they/PRP also/RB make/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ lemon/NN curd/NN which/WDT is/VBZ something/NN that/WDT I/PRP used/VBD to/TO enjoy/VB in/IN Australia/NNP but/CC really/RB have/VB n't/RB seen/VB much/RB around/RB in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. The/DT scones/NNS could/MD be/VB a/DT little/JJ more/JJ buttery/JJ in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBD the/DT strawberry/NN jam/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT little/JJ thicker/NN in/IN consistency/NN ./. But/CC one/CD has/VBZ to/TO applaud/VB Kelvin/PRP 's/POS effort/NN in/IN making/VBG everything/NN in/IN house/NN ./. Conclusion/NN It/PRP is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ to/TO see/VB a/DT 4th/JJ generation/NN baker/NN keeping/VBG some/NN of/IN our/PRP$ traditional/JJ confectioneries/NN alive/NN !/. It/PRP was/VBD such/JJ a/DT pleasant/JJ surprise/NN to/TO re-discover/VB the/DT joy/NN of/IN the/DT good/JJ old/JJ butter/NN cake/NN and/CC realizing/NN how/RB well/RB it/PRP goes/VBZ with/IN a/DT cup/NN of/IN Kopi/NN ./. I/PRP also/RB applaud/VB Kelvin/NN for/IN keeping/VBG to/TO his/PRP$ grandfather/NN 's/POS philosophy/NN of/IN pricing/VBG their/PRP$ confectioneries/NNS so/RB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ accessible/JJ to/TO the/DT masses/NN ./. Perhaps/RB it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB as/IN significant/JJ now/RB as/IN it/PRP was/VBD in/IN the/DT past/IN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ to/TO know/VB that/WDT there/EX are/VBP nice/JJ cafes/NNS around/IN where/WRB you/PRP can/MD have/VB a/DT cake/NN and/CC kopi/NN for/IN less/JJ than/IN $/$ 4/CD ./. We/PRP should/MD see/VB many/JJ more/JJ kopi/NN cafes/NNS selling/VBG these/DT traditional/JJ cakes/NNS soon/RB ,/, but/CC not/RB everyone/VB can/MD boast/VB of/IN a/DT legacy/NN like/IN Dong/NNP Po/NNP 's/POS ./.
