<title>Israel Food Trip: Street Food of Old Jerusalem</title>
<text>If/IN you/PRP missed/JJ part/NN one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ Israel/NN Food/NN Trip/NN then/RB please/JJ click/NN here/RB to/TO read/VB it/PRP first/RB ./. Seriously/RB ,/, you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB watch/VB part/NN 2/CD of/IN a/DT 2/CD parter/NNS without/IN watching/VBG part/NN one/CD first/JJ right/NN ?/. But/CC ok/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO ,/, just/RB read/VB on/IN ,/, but/CC do/VBP n't/RB blame/VB me/PRP if/IN you/PRP are/VBP lost/JJ !/. So/CC I/PRP awoke/VBD to/TO a/DT beautiful/JJ sunrise/NN over/IN the/DT Sea/NN of/IN Galilee/VBG all/DT excited/NN because/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT day/NN we/PRP visit/VB Jerusalem/VB !/. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT day/NN I/PRP get/VB to/TO visit/VB the/DT Mount/NN of/IN Olives/NN ,/, the/DT Garden/NNP of/IN Gethsemane/NN and/CC walk/VBD the/DT Via/NN Dolorosa/NN to/TO the/DT Church/NN of/IN the/DT Holy/NNP Sepulchre/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ built/JJ over/IN the/DT site/NN where/WRB the/DT crucifixion/NN of/IN Christ/NN took/VBD place/NN ./. And/CC yes/EX ,/, I/PRP was/VBD also/RB on/IN a/DT mission/NN to/TO find/VB the/DT iconic/JJ Israeli/NN dishes/NNS which/WRB ,/, I/PRP must/MD admit/VB ,/, still/RB eludes/VBD me/PRP after/IN our/PRP$ first/JJ day/NN in/IN Israel/NN ./. A/DT lot/NN of/IN my/PRP$ friends/NNS who/WP have/VB been/VBN on/IN the/DT holy/NN tour/NN keep/VB telling/VBG me/PRP that/WDT I/PRP need/VB to/TO bring/VB a/DT bottle/NN of/IN Sambal/NNP Belachan/NNP along/IN because/IN the/DT food/NN in/IN Israel/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB blah/JJ ./. I/PRP guess/VB the/DT tour/JJ guides/NN were/VBD focussed/RB more/JJ on/IN the/DT spiritual/NN aspect/NN of/IN such/JJ tours/NN rather/RB than/IN the/DT pleasureable/NNP -LRB-/NNP carnal/NNP -RRB-/NNP parts/NNS ./. Hey/UH ,/, you/PRP are/VBP on/IN a/DT pilgrimage/JJ right/NN ?/. You/PRP should/VB be/VB praying/JJ and/CC fasting/RB rather/RB than/IN thinking/VBG about/IN food/NN !/. But/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB buy/VB that/IN ./. I/PRP think/VB the/DT tour/JJ guides/NN just/RB bring/IN you/PRP to/TO places/NNS that/WDT are/VBP easy/JJ to/TO get/VB seats/NNS for/IN big/JJ groups/NN which/WDT usually/RB mean/VB that/IN they/PRP are/VBP pretty/RB empty/JJ ,/, which/WDT usually/RB means/NN that/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ not/RB great/JJ to/TO start/VB with/IN ,/, which/WDT means/NN that/IN restaurants/NN pay/VB the/DT tour/JJ guides/NN commissions/NN to/TO divert/VB their/PRP$ groups/NN of/IN clueless/NN tourists/NN there/RB ./. So/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP are/VBP planning/VBG to/TO tour/VB Israel/NN with/IN your/PRP$ church/NN group/NN ,/, do/VB some/DT research/NN first/JJ -LRB-/NN like/IN read/VB this/DT blog/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC go/VB find/VB yourself/PRP$ something/NN good/JJ to/TO eat/VB rather/RB than/RB putting/IN your/PRP$ stomach/NN at/IN the/DT mercy/NN of/IN the/DT tour/NN guide/NN !/. Either/JJ that/WDT or/CC maybe/RB you/PRP should/MD just/RB take/VB the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO fast/RB and/CC pray/NN ./. Either/JJ way/NN just/RB remember/VB my/PRP$ adage/NN :/: ``/NNP Never/NNP Waste/NNP Your/NNP Calories/NNP on/IN Yucky/NNP Food/NNP !/. ''/RB Our/PRP$ morning/NN started/VBD with/IN a/DT view/VB of/IN Jerusalem/NN from/IN the/DT Mount/NN of/IN Olives/NN ./. This/DT was/VBD where/RB we/PRP caught/VBN a/DT glimpse/NN of/IN the/DT Temple/JJ Mount/NN upon/IN which/WDT sits/VBZ the/DT Dome/NN of/IN the/DT Rock/NN ./. This/DT Muslim/NN landmark/NN was/VBD built/RB over/IN where/WRB the/DT Jewish/NN Temple/NN used/VBD to/TO stand/VB after/IN it/PRP was/VBD destroyed/VBN by/IN the/DT Romans/NN in/IN 70/NNP AD/NNP ./. The/DT Dome/NN of/IN the/DT Rock/NN is/VBZ probably/RB the/DT most/NN iconic/JJ structure/NN of/IN Jerusalem/NN and/CC is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT oldest/JJ Muslim/NN structures/NN which/WRB was/VBD built/JJ over/IN the/DT spot/NN where/WRB it/PRP was/VBD believed/JJ that/IN the/DT Prophet/JJ Mohammed/NN embarked/NN on/IN his/PRP$ night/NN journey/NN to/TO meet/VB with/IN God/NN ./. We/PRP then/RB continued/VBD our/PRP$ tour/JJ by/IN entering/VBG the/DT Lion/NN 's/POS gate/NN which/WDT took/VBD us/PRP to/TO the/DT starting/VBG point/NN of/IN the/DT Via/NN Dolorasa/NN ./. But/CC rather/RB than/IN tracing/VBG the/DT path/JJ from/IN start/VB to/TO finish/VB ,/, our/JJ guide/NN took/VBD a/DT detour/JJ halfway/NN through/IN to/TO take/VB us/PRP out/VB of/IN the/DT heat/NN and/CC humidity/NN into/IN the/DT tranquility/NN of/IN the/DT cafe/NN situated/NN at/IN the/DT Armenian/NN Hospice/NN ./. The/DT contrast/NN between/IN the/DT beautiful/JJ garden/NN cafe/NN and/CC the/DT busy/VB streets/NN below/IN is/VBZ truly/RB amazing/JJ ,/, as/IN was/VBD the/DT ice/NN coffee/NN at/IN the/DT cafe/NN ./. Definitely/RB a/DT quick/JJ stopover/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP walking/VBG the/DT Via/JJ Dolorosa/NN !/. Like/JJ most/NN foodie/NN trips/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN on/IN ,/, there/RB really/RB is/VBZ n't/RB a/DT fixed/JJ time/NN for/IN three/CD standard/JJ meals/NNS ./. Basically/RB ,/, we/PRP just/RB ate/VBD whenever/IN there/RB was/VBD an/DT opportunity/NN ./. So/RB between/IN morning/NN tea/NN and/CC lunch/NN time/NN ,/, our/PRP guide/RB took/VBD us/PRP$ for/IN a/DT quick/JJ bite/VB of/IN another/DT Israeli/JJ favorite/NN street/NN food/NN ,/, the/DT falafel/NN ./. Now/JJ ,/, if/IN you/PRP have/VBP always/RB associated/VB the/DT falafel/NN with/IN other/JJ Middle/NN Eastern/NN cuisines/NN OTHER/NN than/IN Israeli/JJ cuisine/NN ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB blame/VB you/PRP ./. In/IN Australia/NNP ,/, I/PRP have/VBP always/RB associated/JJ falafel/NN with/IN Lebanese/NN cuisine/NN ./. On/JJ the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, if/IN you/PRP live/JJ in/IN the/DT US/NNP where/WRB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT sizeable/JJ Jewish/NN population/NN ,/, you/PRP might/VB see/VB it/PRP as/IN Israeli/JJ food/NN ./. Falafel/PRP probably/RB originated/VBD in/IN Egypt/NN although/RB there/RB are/VBP some/JJ theories/NN that/WDT say/VB that/WDT it/PRP originated/RB from/IN India/NN instead/RB ./. That/DT would/MD n't/RB be/VB too/RB far/JJ fetched/NN since/IN the/DT falafel/NN is/VBZ very/RB similar/JJ to/TO those/DT vadai/NN that/WDT are/VBP made/VBD from/IN lentils/NN and/CC chickpeas/NN ./. Whatever/WP its/PRP$ origins/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ claimed/JJ by/IN Egypt/NN ,/, Palestine/NN and/CC Israel/NN as/IN their/PRP$ national/NN dish/NN ./. But/CC unlike/RB the/DT thorny/JJ but/CC seldom/JJ serious/JJ skirmishes/NN that/WDT Malaysia/NNP and/CC Singapore/NNP occiasionally/NNP have/VBZ over/RB who/WP owns/VBZ Bak/NNP Kut/NNP Teh/NNP and/CC Chilli/NNP Crabs/NNS ,/, the/DT debate/NN over/IN who/WP owns/VBZ Falafel/NN is/VBZ often/JJ seen/NN as/IN a/DT reflection/NN of/IN the/DT poitical/JJ situation/NN in/IN the/DT region/NN ./. I/PRP am/VBP amazed/JJ at/IN just/RB how/RB small/JJ the/DT old/JJ city/NN really/RB is/VBZ ./. You/PRP can/MD basically/VB walk/RB from/IN one/CD end/NN to/IN the/DT other/JJ end/NN within/IN an/DT hour/NN or/CC even/RB quicker/VB if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB stop/VB to/TO buy/VB ,/, smell/NN or/CC eat/VB something/NN ./. The/DT city/NN itself/PRP is/VBZ divided/JJ into/IN four/NNP quarters/NNP ,/, viz/NNP ,/, Jewish/NN ,/, Christian/NN ,/, Muslim/NN and/CC Armenian/NN quarters/NN and/CC though/IN there/EX are/VBP no/RB distinct/JJ borders/NN between/IN the/DT quarters/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ interesting/JJ how/WRB you/PRP can/MD just/RB turn/VB one/CD corner/NN and/CC suddenly/RB find/VB them/PRP selling/VBG a/DT range/NN of/IN different/JJ things/NNS ./. We/PRP stopped/NN for/IN afternoon/NN tea/NN in/IN the/DT Muslim/JJ quarter/NN to/TO try/VB some/DT Kanafeh/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ an/DT Arabic/JJ dessert/NN that/IN originated/NN in/IN the/DT city/NN of/IN Nablus/NN ./. The/DT Jerusalem/NN version/NN is/VBZ bright/JJ orange/JJ in/IN color/NN and/CC consist/VB of/IN a/DT layer/NN of/IN goat/NN cheese/NN topped/VBD with/IN semnolina/NN ,/, baked/VBD and/CC then/RB drenched/VBD in/IN a/DT rose/JJ scented/NN syrup/NN ./. Like/JJ most/NN of/IN the/DT desserts/NNS in/IN the/DT Middle/NNP East/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB rich/JJ and/CC sweet/JJ which/WDT I/PRP thought/VBD would/MD go/VB well/RB with/IN a/DT cup/NN of/IN tea/NN ./. But/CC over/IN the/DT next/JJ few/JJ days/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD come/VB to/TO realize/VB that/IN a/DT good/JJ cup/NN of/IN tea/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB hard/JJ to/TO find/VB in/IN Israel/NN ./. The/DT drink/NN of/IN choice/NN is/VBZ coffee/NN ./. With/IN tea/NN ,/, they/PRP tend/VBD to/TO add/VB mint/NN or/CC some/DT other/JJ herbs/NN in/IN it/PRP and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO find/VB a/DT decent/JJ milk/NN tea/NN anywhere/NN !/. If/IN you/PRP do/VB come/VB to/TO Jerusalem/VB ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT places/NNS that/WDT you/PRP should/VB try/VB to/TO visit/VB is/VBZ Zalatimo/RB 's/POS Murthabak/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBP heard/VBN so/RB much/JJ about/IN them/PRP but/CC on/IN the/DT day/NN we/PRP were/VBD in/IN Jerusalem/NN ,/, my/PRP$ guide/NN told/VBD me/PRP that/IN they/PRP were/VBD closed/VBD ./. I/PRP was/VBD quite/RB fascinated/JJ with/IN Zalatimo/NN 's/POS because/IN this/DT really/RB looks/VBZ like/IN the/DT Murthabak/NN that/IN we/PRP get/VBP here/RB in/IN Singapore/NNP except/NNP that/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ filled/VBD with/IN goat/NN 's/POS cheese/NN instead/RB ./. I/PRP have/VBP always/RB assumed/VB that/IN Murthabak/PRP came/VBD from/IN India/JJ but/CC was/VBD fascinated/JJ to/TO learn/VB that/IN it/PRP actually/RB originated/VBD in/IN Yemen/NN which/WDT explains/VBZ how/WRB its/PRP$ been/VBN sold/VBN in/IN Jerusalem/NN since/IN 1860/NN ./. We/PRP continued/VB our/PRP$ quest/NN to/TO find/VB the/DT best/JJ hummus/NN in/IN Israel/NN and/CC ended/NN up/NN at/IN Lina/NNP 's/POS restaurant/NN which/WDT was/VBD one/CD of/IN the/DT top/JJ places/NNS for/IN hummus/NN in/IN Old/NNP Jerusalem/NNP ./. I/PRP was/VBD busy/VB talking/VBG to/TO the/DT owner/NN ,/, so/RB by/IN the/DT time/NN I/PRP got/VBD upstairs/NNS ,/, I/PRP could/MD only/RB take/VB a/DT photo/NN of/IN a/DT half/JJ dipped/NN plate/NN of/IN hummus/NN !/. Here/RB 's/POS my/PRP$ friend/NN Micha/NN demonstrating/IN the/DT right/JJ way/NN to/TO eat/VB hummus/NN ./. I/PRP think/VB the/DT main/JJ thing/NN about/IN hummus/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ more/JJR than/IN just/RB a/DT dip/VB where/WRB you/PRP simply/VB flavor/NN the/DT bread/NN with/IN the/DT paste/NN ./. Rather/JJ ,/, the/DT bread/NN is/VBZ only/RB serves/VBZ as/IN a/DT means/NN of/IN scooping/NN up/IN the/DT hummus/NN and/CC the/DT aim/NN of/IN the/DT game/NN is/VBZ to/TO get/VB a/DT decent/JJ mouthful/NN of/IN the/DT stuff/NN with/IN each/JJ scoop/NN !/. For/IN dinner/NN ,/, we/PRP headed/JJ out/IN of/IN Old/NNP Jerusalem/NN to/TO the/DT Machaneyuda/JJ restaurant/NN that/WDT was/VBD located/VBN near/IN the/DT famous/JJ Machane/NN Yehuda/NN market/NN ./. This/DT place/NN serves/VBZ Mediterranean/JJ style/NN cuisine/NN using/VBG the/DT local/NN produced/VBD that/WDT is/VBZ sold/VBN at/IN the/DT market/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ reputedly/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ restaurants/NN in/IN Israel/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ that/WDT there/EX is/VBZ a/DT one/CD month/NN waiting/VBG list/NN ,/, so/RB you/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO plan/VB ahead/RB if/IN you/PRP wish/VBP to/TO dine/VB there/RB ./. The/DT food/NN there/RB is/VBZ fresh/JJ and/CC well/RB executed/JJ and/CC if/IN the/DT tour/NN guides/NN were/VBD to/TO bring/VB their/PRP$ groups/NN there/RB ,/, no/RB one/CD would/MD ever/RB complain/VB that/IN food/NN in/IN Israel/NN is/VBZ blah/RB ./. Although/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB a/DT kosher/JJ restaurant/NN ,/, they/PRP do/VB serve/VB kosher/JJ food/NN on/IN request/VB ./. So/RB for/IN Jews/NN observing/IN the/DT kosher/NN laws/NN ,/, they/PRP have/VBN a/DT dish/NN of/IN spiced/NN minced/NN lamb/NN without/IN the/DT cream/NN sauce/NN ./. We/PRP tried/VBD both/DT version/NN and/CC I/PRP must/VB admit/VB that/WDT I/PRP prefer/VB the/DT creamy/JJ version/NN ./. The/DT best/JJS way/NN to/TO describe/VB the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ downright/JJ straightforward/NN ,/, unpretentious/NN and/CC unencumbered/NN ,/, very/RB much/JJ like/IN most/NN Israelis/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP met/VBN ./. The/DT food/NN is/VBZ undoubtedly/RB good/JJ but/CC the/DT highlight/VB of/IN the/DT evening/NN was/VBD when/RB the/DT music/NN started/VBD and/CC people/NNS got/VBD up/RP to/TO dance/VB right/NN in/IN the/DT middle/JJ of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN !/. Then/RB the/DT chefs/NN in/IN the/DT kitchen/NN started/VBD to/TO join/VB in/IN and/CC turned/VBD the/DT pots/NN and/CC pans/NN into/IN percussion/JJ instruments/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD the/DT most/NN amazing/JJ thing/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB seen/VB which/WRB I/PRP would/MD never/RB expect/VB to/TO see/VB in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. It/PRP really/RB felt/VBD like/IN a/DT flash/JJ mob/NN as/IN the/DT chefs/NN all/RB got/VBN back/RB to/TO cooking/NN again/RB when/WRB the/DT music/NN stopped/NN !/. That/DT was/VBD the/DT end/NN of/IN yet/RB another/DT eventful/JJ day/NN !/. Tomorrow/JJ ,/, we/PRP head/VBP to/TO Machane/VB Yehuda/NN market/NN !/. Stay/PRP tuned/VBD !/. Read/JJ Part/NN 1/CD ,/, Part/NN 3/CD and/CC Part/VBD 4/CD of/IN my/PRP$ Israel/NN Food/NN Trip/NN ./. This/DT trip/NN was/VBD sponsored/RB by/IN Taste/NN of/IN Israel/NN ./. </text>
