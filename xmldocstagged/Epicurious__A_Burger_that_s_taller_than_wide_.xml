<title>Epicurious: A Burger that's taller than wide!</title>
<text>When/WRB a/DT man/NN from/IN the/DT UK/NN brings/IN you/PRP to/TO eat/VB a/DT Burger/NNP in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, one/CD has/VBZ to/TO wonder/VB what/WP the/DT fuss/NN is/VBZ all/RB about/IN !/. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT Big/JJ MOG/NN 's/POS favorite/NN burger/NN and/CC he/PRP proudly/RB claims/VBD that/IN he/PRP ca/MD n't/RB get/VB a/DT nicer/JJ burger/NN than/IN this/DT in/IN Britain/NN ./. I/PRP find/VB that/IN hard/JJ to/TO believe/VB at/IN first/JJ ./. But/CC I/PRP guess/VB the/DT burger/NN must/MD be/VB more/RB an/DT American/JJ thing/NN than/IN a/DT British/JJ thing/NN ./. Anyway/RB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP happy/JJ to/TO include/VB this/DT Burger/NNP into/IN my/PRP$ list/NN of/IN Burgers/NNS because/IN it/PRP gets/VBZ the/DT award/NN for/IN the/DT thickest/JJ pattie/NN I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB come/VB across/IN ./. When/WRB you/PRP put/VB the/DT whole/JJ burger/NN together/RB ,/, it/PRP actually/RB lookes/VBD taller/RB than/IN it/PRP is/VBZ wide/JJ !/. But/CC small/JJ eaters/NNS need/VB not/RB be/VB alarmed/NN because/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT Burger/NNP for/IN those/RB who/WP simply/VBZ like/IN Beef/NN and/CC not/RB the/DT Bread/NN ./. The/DT buns/NNS they/PRP use/VBP are/VBP really/RB quite/RB small/JJ ,/, about/IN the/DT diameter/NN of/IN an/DT apple/NN ./. Actually/RB ,/, the/DT 2oog/JJ pattie/NN -LRB-/IN they/PRP mince/VB it/PRP themselves/RB -RRB-/VBD is/VBZ so/RB thick/JJ that/IN it/PRP can/MD almost/RB be/VB described/NN as/IN an/DT Xtra/JJ Huge/NN Meatball/NN ./. The/DT burger/NN itself/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB juicy/JJ and/CC tastes/VBZ great/JJ with/IN the/DT bacon/NN ,/, onions/NN and/CC egg/NN ./. The/DT pattie/NN itself/PRP could/MD have/VB been/VBN a/DT little/JJ more/NN beefy/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP guess/VBP being/VBG a/DT homemade/JJ pattie/NN ,/, they/PRP have/VBP chosen/VBN to/TO use/VB less/JJ fat/NN in/IN the/DT mince/VB ./. That/DT 's/POS good/JJ for/IN those/RB who/WP are/VBP more/JJ health/JJ conscious/NN ./. Great/JJ burger/NN for/IN those/DT who/WP enjoy/VB a/DT big/JJ juicy/NN beef/NN pattie/NN but/CC do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO get/VB too/RB full/JJ from/IN eating/VBG the/DT bread/NN ./. The/DT cafe/NN is/VBZ situated/RB next/JJ to/TO the/DT river/NN and/CC it/PRP 's/POS quite/RB rustic/JJ as/IN the/DT place/NN is/VBZ filled/VBD with/IN antique/JJ wooden/NN furniture/NN ./. More/NNP expensive/NNP compared/VBD to/TO the/DT other/JJ burgers/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ burger/NN list/NN but/CC I/PRP guess/VBP you/PRP are/VBP paying/VBG extra/JJ for/IN the/DT ambiance/NN ./. Tuesday/WP -/: Friday/NNP 11.30/NNP am/VBZ -/: 2.30/NNP pm/NNP ,/, 5.30/NNP pm/NNP -/: 9.30/NNP pm/NNP Saturday/NNP &amp;/CC Sunday/NNP 9.00/NNP am/VBZ -/: 9.30/NNP pm/NNP </text>
