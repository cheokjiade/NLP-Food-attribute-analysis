<title>Mary's Corner: Tau Kwa Pau</title>
<text>Tau/NN Kwa/NN Pau/NNP -LRB-/NNP Bean/NN Curd/NN Pau/NNP -RRB-/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN those/DT hawker/NN dishes/NNS that/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB readily/VB find/VB anywhere/RB ,/, so/RB it/PRP is/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO make/VB a/DT comparison/NN and/CC say/VB which/WDT one/CD is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS ./. It/PRP seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP that/WDT all/PDT the/DT mediocre/NN ones/NNS have/VBP left/VBN the/DT scene/NN and/CC what/WP 's/POS left/VBN are/VBP the/DT ones/NNS which/WDT are/VBP relatively/RB good/JJ ./. Now/RB if/IN something/NN is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ ,/, why/WRB are/VBP n't/RB there/RB more/JJ people/NN cashing/NN in/IN on/IN the/DT opportunity/NN ?/. ie/IN if/IN Tau/NN Kwa/NN Pau/NNP is/VBZ really/RB that/RB good/JJ to/TO eat/VB ,/, why/WRB are/VBP n't/RB there/RB more/JJ Tau/NN Kwa/NN Pau/NNP vendors/NNP around/IN ?/. It/PRP 's/VBZ like/IN mooncakes/NN ./. If/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ so/RB shiok/JJ ,/, why/WRB are/VBP n't/RB they/PRP sold/VBN all/DT year/NN round/NN like/IN what/WP happened/VBD to/TO Bak/NNP Changs/NNP ?/. Tau/NN Kwa/NN Pau/NNP is/VBZ a/DT Teochew/NNP Nonya/NNP dish/NN ./. Even/RB the/DT stallowners/NN do/VBP n't/RB know/VB why/WRB ./. I/PRP think/VB it/PRP is/VBZ because/IN Tau/NN Kwa/NN Pau/NNP uses/VBZ Braised/RB Soy/JJ Sauce/NN for/IN its/PRP$ flavoring/NN so/IN it/PRP is/VBZ frequently/RB sold/VBD by/IN Brasied/NN Duck/NN stalls/NNS ./. This/DT stall/NN however/NN ,/, sells/VBZ only/RB TKP/JJ ./. The/DT picture/NN above/NN shows/IN the/DT stuffing/VBG that/IN they/PRP throw/VBD on/IN top/NN of/IN the/DT Tau/NN Kwas/NN ./. I/PRP took/VBD this/DT pic/NN for/IN those/RB who/WP ,/, like/IN me/PRP ,/, might/VB be/VB curious/JJ to/TO know/VB what/WP ingredients/NNS actually/RB go/VB into/IN the/DT stuffing/VBG ./. This/DT stall/NN uses/VBZ 3/CD types/NNS of/IN fish/NN cakes/NNS ./. The/DT normal/JJ one/CD on/IN the/DT left/JJ ,/, the/DT thin/JJ fish/NN strips/NN in/IN the/DT middle/JJ and/CC the/DT Spiced/JJ fish/NN cake/NN on/IN the/DT right/NN ./. I/PRP know/VB of/IN other/JJ stalls/NNS which/WRB uses/VBZ braised/VBN egg/NN and/CC duck/NN meat/NN as/IN well/RB ./. The/DT stuff/NN above/NN is/VBZ the/DT Shredded/JJ Yam/NN cake/NN which/WRB has/VBZ been/VBN reshredded/NN and/CC fried/VBD till/NN crispy/NN ./. Do/VBP n't/RB ask/VB me/PRP why/WRB they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB just/RB shred/RB raw/JJ yam/NN and/CC deep/VB fry/VB it/PRP ./. The/DT beauty/NN of/IN Tau/NN Kwa/NN Pau/NNP is/VBZ in/IN the/DT contrast/NN of/IN tastes/VBZ and/CC texture/NN that/IN each/JJ ingredient/NN brings/NN to/TO the/DT overall/NN experience/NN ./. So/CC you/PRP have/VB the/DT crunchiness/NN of/IN the/DT cucumber/NN ,/, the/DT crispy/JJ fish/NN strips/NN and/CC Yam/NN contrasting/NN with/IN the/DT softness/NN of/IN the/DT Tau/NN Kwa/NN and/CC egg/NN ,/, the/DT savoury/NN taste/NN of/IN the/DT Lor/NN and/CC Five/CD Spiced/NNP Fish/NNP cake/NNP with/IN the/DT blandness/NN of/IN the/DT Tau/NN Kua/NN and/CC cucumber/NN ./. I/PRP think/VB it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT yummy/JJ dish/NN to/TO have/VB as/IN a/DT snack/NN ./. But/CC as/IN I/PRP alluded/VBD to/TO in/IN my/PRP$ introduction/NN ,/, if/IN Tau/NN Kwa/NN Pau/NNP is/VBZ so/RB die/VB die/VB must/VB try/VB ,/, then/RB surely/RB there/RB will/VB be/VB more/JJ stalls/NNS all/DT over/IN the/DT island/NN !/. For/IN comparison/NN ,/, there/RB is/VBZ another/DT famous/JJ Tau/NN Kwa/NN Pau/NNP stall/NN diagonally/IN opposite/JJ the/DT intersection/NN ./. They/PRP had/VBD moved/VBN from/IN the/DT coffeeshop/NN recently/RB from/IN the/DT coffeeshop/NN on/IN the/DT opposite/JJ side/NN of/IN Joo/NNP Chiat/NNP Road/NNP ./. I/PRP tried/VBD it/PRP once/RB but/CC was/VBD unimpressed/RB ,/, though/IN there/EX are/VBP people/NNS who/WP do/VB rave/VB about/IN it/PRP ./. </text>
