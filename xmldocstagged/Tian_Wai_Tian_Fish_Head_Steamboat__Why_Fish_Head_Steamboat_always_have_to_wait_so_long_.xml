<title>Tian Wai Tian Fish Head Steamboat: Why Fish Head Steamboat always have to wait so long?</title>
<text>I/PRP must/MD have/VB visited/VBN this/DT coffeeshop/NN countless/NN of/IN times/NNS in/IN my/PRP$ ten/CD years/NNS studying/RB at/IN St/NNP Andrew/NNP 's/POS School/NNP ./. It/PRP is/VBZ located/VBD just/RB across/IN the/DT PIE/NN from/IN the/DT school/NN and/CC I/PRP remember/VB days/NNS when/WRB I/PRP would/MD walk/VB down/VB to/TO the/DT coffeeshop/NN to/TO buy/VB ,/, what/WP was/VBD to/TO me/PRP ,/, the/DT best/JJ big/JJ pau/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ./. In/IN my/PRP$ mind/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB the/DT best/JJ big/JJ pau/NNS ever/RB and/CC had/VBD pieces/NN of/IN chicken/NN with/IN the/DT bones/NNS still/RB attached/VBN in/IN it/PRP !/. Too/DT bad/JJ they/PRP stopped/VBP selling/VBG it/PRP sometime/NN ago/RB ./. I/PRP hope/VBD it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB because/IN someone/NN choked/NN on/IN the/DT chicken/NN bone/NN !/. Anyway/RB ,/, I/PRP never/RB knew/VBD about/IN the/DT Fishhead/JJ steamboat/NN at/IN the/DT time/NN ./. Tian/NNP Wai/NNP Tian/NNP started/VBD selling/VBG their/PRP$ Fishhead/JJ steamboat/NN there/RB in/IN the/DT early/JJ eighties/NN so/IN they/PRP were/VBD newbies/RB when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD in/IN school/NN ./. Fast/RB forward/VB 20/CD odd/CD years/NNS later/RB and/CC Tian/NNP Wai/NNP Tian/NNP now/RB controls/VBZ a/DT Steamboat/JJ empire/NN with/IN a/DT few/JJ branches/NNS around/IN the/DT island/NN ./. But/CC those/RB who/WP are/VBP familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT original/JJ shop/NN will/MD tell/VB you/PRP that/WDT the/DT steamboat/NN here/RB is/VBZ still/RB the/DT best/JJS !/. And/CC why/WRB not/RB ?/. The/DT original/JJ Lau/NN Ban/NN Niang/NN who/WP started/VBD it/PRP when/WRB she/PRP was/VBD a/DT young/JJ lady/NN is/VBZ still/RB at/IN the/DT shop/NN keeping/VBG an/DT eye/NN on/IN everything/NN ./. Back/VBN in/IN the/DT days/NNS when/WRB Tian/NNP Wai/NNP Tian/NNP first/RB started/VBD ,/, there/RB were/VBD n't/RB as/IN many/JJ stalls/NNS selling/VBG Fish/NNP Head/NNP Steamboat/NNP ./. Nowadays/RB ,/, it/PRP seems/VBZ that/IN quite/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN Cze/NNP Char/NNP places/NNS are/VBP offering/VBG it/PRP ./. Just/RB recently/RB ,/, I/PRP came/VBD across/IN one/CD that/WDT added/VBD Tang/NN Gui/NN to/TO the/DT soup/NN and/CC finished/VB it/PRP with/IN a/DT splash/NN of/IN XO/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD interesting/JJ at/IN first/JJ but/CC I/PRP soon/RB got/VBD tired/NN of/IN it/PRP after/IN the/DT first/JJ bowl/NN ./. I/PRP much/RB prefer/VB the/DT classic/JJ taste/NN of/IN sole/JJ fish/NN and/CC sour/NN plums/NN which/WDT is/VBZ what/WP Tian/NNP Wai/NNP Tian/NNP delivers/NNP ./. So/RB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ classic/JJ Teochew/NNP Fish/NNP Head/NNP Steamboat/NNP you/PRP are/VBP after/IN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ it/PRP and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ about/IN as/IN good/JJ as/IN it/PRP gets/VBZ ./. The/DT soup/NN has/VBZ got/VBN lots/NNS of/IN body/NN ,/, plenty/NN of/IN savoury/NN sole/NN -LRB-/JJ fish/NN -RRB-/NN ,/, fish/NN is/VBZ fresh/JJ and/CC they/PRP are/VBP served/VBN in/IN charcoal/NNP aluminium/NNP steamboat/NNP pots/NNP that/WDT are/VBZ as/IN old/JJ as/IN the/DT shop/NN ./. Just/JJ about/IN the/DT only/JJ thing/NN missing/NN that/IN night/NN was/VBD Tang/RB Orh/JJ -LRB-/NN Chrysanthemum/NN leaves/VBZ -RRB-/RB ./. Not/RB sure/VB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ because/IN they/PRP ran/VB out/VB that/IN night/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP consider/VB Tang/VB Orh/RB an/DT essential/JJ ingredient/NN for/IN a/DT good/JJ fish/NN head/NN steamboat/NN ./. Like/DT all/NN of/IN the/DT other/JJ famous/JJ Fish/NN head/NN steamboat/NN places/NNS in/IN the/DT blog/NN ,/, the/DT wait/NN to/TO get/VB your/PRP$ sinuses/NNP cleared/NNP can/MD be/VB quite/RB long/JJ ./. So/RB be/VB prepared/VBD ./. In/IN the/DT meantime/NN ,/, most/NN people/NN will/MD order/VB some/DT deep/JJ fried/VBN nibblies/NN to/TO satisfy/VB the/DT need/NN to/TO feed/VB ./. The/DT dish/NN which/WDT I/PRP can/MD recommend/VB is/VBZ the/DT Hae/NN Chor/NNP ./. It/PRP was/VBD flavourful/JJ and/CC had/VBD chunks/NN of/IN water/NN chestnuts/NN in/IN it/PRP to/TO give/VB it/PRP lots/RB of/IN crunch/VB ./. This/DT dish/NN came/VBD out/IN from/IN a/DT special/JJ frying/VBG station/RB located/VBN in/IN an/DT abandoned/NN stall/NN space/NN where/WRB the/DT man/NN does/VBZ nothing/NN but/CC deep/VB fry/VB stuff/NN ./. You/PRP can/MD imagine/VB the/DT volume/NN he/PRP turns/VBZ over/IN since/IN almost/RB everyone/RB has/VB some/DT sort/NN of/IN crispy/NN crunchy/JJ on/IN their/PRP$ table/NN !/. Aside/RB from/IN the/DT Steamboat/NN and/CC the/DT Hae/NN Chor/NNP ,/, the/DT other/JJ dishes/NNS which/WRB we/PRP tried/VBD were/VBD pretty/RB ordinary/JJ ./. The/DT Har/NN Cheong/NN Gai/NN is/VBZ crispy/JJ and/CC fresh/JJ simply/NN because/IN it/PRP was/VBD freshly/JJ fried/VBD ./. It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ deep/JJ fried/VBD chicken/NN wings/NN ,/, but/CC as/IN a/DT Har/JJ Cheong/NN Gai/NN ,/, the/DT flavor/NN just/RB was/VBD n't/RB pungent/VB enough/RB ./. ./. You/PRP 'd/MD be/VB better/NN off/IN not/RB ordering/VBG the/DT Pai/JJ Gu/NN Wang/NN as/IN it/PRP was/VBD limp/JJ and/CC insipid/JJ ./. 3\/5/JJ ./. I/PRP did/VBD notice/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN tables/NN ordering/VBG Tofu/NN Prawns/NN which/WRB I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB order/VB the/DT next/JJ time/NN I/PRP visit/VB ./. Conclusion/NN Great/JJ place/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT great/JJ Fish/NN head/NN Steamboat/NN !/. However/RB ,/, there/RB are/VBP hits/JJ and/CC misses/JJ amongst/NN the/DT Cze/NNP Char/NNP dishes/NNS ,/, so/RB you/PRP 'll/VB need/VB to/TO choose/VB carefully/NN ./.
