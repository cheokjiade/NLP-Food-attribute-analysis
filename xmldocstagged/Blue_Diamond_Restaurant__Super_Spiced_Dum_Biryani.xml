<title>Blue Diamond Restaurant: Super Spiced Dum Biryani</title>
<text>I/PRP think/VBP there/RB are/VBP essentially/RB two/CD schools/NNS of/IN foodies/NNS when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO Nasi/NNP Biryani/NNP ./. There/EX are/VBP those/RB who/WP like/IN a/DT heavy/JJ Biryani/NN where/WRB the/DT spices/NNS hit/IN you/PRP like/VB a/DT truck/NN and/CC there/RB are/VBP others/JJ who/WP like/IN the/DT rice/NN to/TO be/VB light/JJ and/CC aromatic/JJ and/CC decide/VBD how/RB much/JJ masala/IN they/PRP want/VBP to/TO eat/VB with/IN each/JJ spoonful/NN ./. I/PRP actually/RB belong/VBD to/TO the/DT latter/JJ group/NN as/IN I/PRP like/VB the/DT light/JJ and/CC airy/JJ texture/NN of/IN long/JJ grained/NN Basmati/NN rice/NN and/CC the/DT natural/JJ fragrance/NN which/WDT makes/VBZ real/JJ Basmati/NN rice/NN special/JJ ./. Of/IN all/DT the/DT rice/NN varietals/NN that/WDT we/PRP commonly/RB eat/VBD ,/, only/RB Basmati/JJ and/CC Thai/JJ Jasmine/NN Rice/NN have/VBN that/IN alluring/JJ fragrance/NN which/WDT ,/, incidentally/NN ,/, is/VBZ a/DT ``/JJ freak/NN of/IN nature/NN ''/NN ./. Most/JJS rice/NN do/VB not/RB have/VB fragrance/NN ,/, but/CC in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN Basmati/NN and/CC Jasmine/NN ,/, there/RB had/VBD been/VBN a/DT mutation/NN of/IN a/DT certain/JJ gene/NN called/VBD BADH2/NN which/WRB causes/VBZ the/DT production/NN of/IN 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline/NN ,/, the/DT aroma/NN compound/NN that/WDT gives/VBZ Jasmine/VBN rice/NN ,/, Basmatic/NN rice/NN and/CC Pandan/NN leaves/VBZ its/PRP$ characteristic/JJ fragrance/NN ./. That/DT explains/NN why/WRB people/NNS like/IN to/TO cook/VB Chicken/NN Rice/NN with/IN a/DT knot/NN of/IN Pandan/NN leaves/VBZ in/IN it/PRP to/TO accentuate/VB its/PRP$ fragrance/NN ./. It/PRP also/RB explains/VB why/WRB Basmati/PRP can/MD also/RB be/VB used/VBD for/IN Nasi/NNP Lemak/NNP as/IN its/PRP$ fragrance/NN can/MD also/VB be/VB accentuated/VBD by/IN Pandan/NN leaves/VBZ and/CC coconut/JJ milk/NN ./. But/CC most/RB of/IN us/PRP have/VBP been/VBN conditioned/VBG to/TO eat/VB Biryani/NNS where/WRB the/DT fragrance/NN essentially/RB comes/VBZ from/IN the/DT spices/NNS used/VBD in/IN the/DT masala/JJ principally/NN because/IN real/JJ Basmati/NN rice/NN is/VBZ quite/RB expensive/JJ ./. So/CC most/JJ shops/NN will/MD not/RB use/VB the/DT top/JJ grade/NN Bastmati/NN rice/NN but/CC instead/RB serve/VB the/DT rice/NN with/IN a/DT robust/JJ masala/NN ./. That/DT is/VBZ not/RB to/TO say/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ necessarily/RB bad/JJ ,/, its/PRP just/RB that/WDT you/PRP miss/VB the/DT essence/NN of/IN what/WP makes/VBZ Basmati/RB so/RB special/JJ ./. Now/JJ ,/, the/DT Biryani/NN at/IN Blue/NN Diamond/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC in/IN the/DT way/NN that/IN each/JJ grain/NN of/IN rice/NN is/VBZ coated/VBN with/IN a/DT very/RB well/RB balanced/VBN masala/NN ./. This/DT shop/NN is/VBZ a/DT favorite/NN amongst/NN our/JJ group/NN of/IN kakis/NNS ./. The/DT boss/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Farook/NNP told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT theirs/NN is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ Dum/NN Biryani/NNS where/WRB the/DT rice/NN and/CC the/DT meat/NN are/VBP cooked/VBN together/RB in/IN a/DT sealed/JJ pot/NN ./. He/PRP had/VBD learned/IN the/DT recipe/NN from/IN various/JJ hotel/NN chefs/NN while/NN he/PRP was/VBD working/VBG in/IN the/DT hotel/NN line/NN for/IN 18/CD years/NNS prior/JJ to/TO opening/VBG Blue/NNP Diamond/NNP ./. My/PRP$ mutton/JJ biryani/NN came/VBD with/IN two/CD generous/JJ pieces/NN of/IN tender/NN lamb/NN pieces/NN which/WRB I/PRP have/VBP no/RB complains/VB about/IN ./. It/PRP was/VBD well/RB spiced/JJ ,/, tender/NN and/CC was/VBD n't/RB gamey/VB ./. My/PRP$ other/JJ kakis/NNS ,/, however/NN ,/, commented/NN that/IN their/PRP$ pieces/NN were/VBD more/JJ bones/NNS than/IN meat/NN ./. The/DT rice/NN was/VBD coated/VBN with/IN a/DT masala/NN which/WRB I/PRP thought/VBD was/VBD going/VBG to/TO be/VB quite/RB heavy/JJ ,/, but/CC turned/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB fragrant/JJ and/CC nicely/RB spiced/RB ./. My/PRP$ kakis/NNS loved/VBD the/DT Biryani/NN here/RB ./. My/PRP$ personal/JJ preference/NN is/VBZ for/IN the/DT lighter/NN version/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP still/RB quite/RB enjoyed/VBN the/DT Biryani/NN as/IN the/DT masala/NN was/VBD n't/RB overly/RB spicy/JJ ./. 4.25/DT \//JJ 5/CD Conclusion/NN If/IN you/PRP are/VBP mad/JJ for/IN masala/NN ,/, then/RB this/DT is/VBZ the/DT place/NN for/IN you/PRP ./. The/DT mutton/NN is/VBZ wonderfully/JJ tender/NN and/CC the/DT masala/NN well/RB balanced/VBN ./. The/DT hard/JJ boiled/NN egg/NN sets/VBZ it/PRP apart/RB from/IN the/DT other/JJ Biryanis/NN and/CC actually/RB goes/VBZ quite/RB well/RB with/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT dish/NN !/. Blue/DT Diamond/JJ Restaurant/NN 24-26/IN Buffalo/NNP Road/NNP ,/, Singapore/NNP 219791/NNP 62911629/NNP 9.30/NNP am/VBZ to/TO 10pm/VB daily/RB </text>
