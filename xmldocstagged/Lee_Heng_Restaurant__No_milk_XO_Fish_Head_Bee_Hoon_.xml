<title>Lee Heng Restaurant: No milk XO Fish Head Bee Hoon!</title>
<text>In/IN England/NNP there/EX is/VBZ the/DT pub/NN ./. In/IN Japan/NNP ,/, the/DT Izakaya/NN ./. Here/RB in/IN Singapore/NNP we/PRP have/VB the/DT Cze/NNP Char/NNP -LRB-/NNP lit/NN cook/VB fry/VB -RRB-/RB ./. The/DT Cze/NNP Char/NNP really/RB started/VBD as/IN a/DT kitchen/NN away/RB from/IN home/NN where/WRB you/PRP get/VB to/TO eat/VB home/NN style/NN cooked/VBN food/NN ./. I/PRP guess/VBP ,/, in/IN the/DT old/JJ days/NNS when/WRB most/NN of/IN our/PRP$ forefathers/NN were/VBD immigrants/RB who/WP have/VBZ left/VBN their/PRP$ families/NN back/RB in/IN their/PRP$ home/NN country/NN ,/, the/DT Cze/NNP Char/NNP is/VBZ their/PRP$ surrogate/JJ home/NN kitchen/NN where/WRB you/PRP come/VB back/RB from/IN a/DT hard/JJ day/NN 's/POS work/NN to/TO find/VB something/NN to/TO eat/VB ./. Our/PRP$ Cze/NNP Char/NNP dishes/NNS are/VBP unique/VBN because/IN they/PRP are/VBP an/DT amalgamation/NN of/IN the/DT styles/NN of/IN cooking/NN from/IN the/DT different/JJ dialect/NN groups/NN mostly/NN from/IN the/DT Southern/NNP Provinces/NN of/IN China/NNP ./. In/IN the/DT early/NN days/NNS ,/, I/PRP would/MD expect/VB that/IN Cze/NNP Chars/NNP could/MD be/VB classified/NN into/IN Teochew/NNP ,/, Hokkien/NNP or/CC Cantonese/NNP ,/, but/CC as/IN time/NN went/VBD by/IN ,/, new/JJ Cze/NNP Char/NNP hits/NNS are/VBP copied/VBN by/IN other/JJ Cze/NNP Char/NNP stalls/NN such/NN that/WDT nowadays/RB ,/, Cze/NNP Chars/NNP serve/VB a/DT cuisine/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB called/VBD uniquely/NN Singaporean/NN ./. The/DT Cze/NNP Char/NNP dishes/NNS continue/VBD to/TO evolve/VB ,/, taking/VBG in/IN the/DT new/JJ ideas/NNS from/IN other/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT world/NN ./. For/IN example/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP Siang/VBN Hee/NN 's/POS pumpkin/NN prawns/NNS which/WRB incorporates/NNP western/NNP flavors/NNS into/IN the/DT dish/NN ./. We/PRP are/VBP also/RB seeing/VBG more/JJR Cze/NNP Char/NNP places/NNS incorporating/RB Japanese/JJ ideas/NNS like/IN wasabi/NN prawns/NNS and/CC fried/VBD udon/NN noodles/NNS ./. Over/JJ time/NN ,/, these/DT too/RB will/VB be/VB considered/JJ classic/NNP Cze/NNP Char/NNP dishes/NNS ./. I/PRP realize/VB that/WDT there/EX are/VBP still/RB so/RB many/JJ Cze/NNP Char/NNP places/NNS which/WRB I/PRP have/VB not/RB blogged/VBD about/IN yet/RB and/CC so/RB I/PRP am/VBP now/RB making/VBG a/DT more/JJ concerted/JJ effort/NN to/TO archive/VB Singapore/NNP 's/POS best/JJS Cze/NNP Char/NNP restaurants/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT daunting/JJ task/NN because/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB difficult/JJ to/TO have/VB a/DT top/JJ 10/CD Cze/NNP Char/NNP restaurant/NN list/NN ./. But/CC what/WP I/PRP thought/VBD would/MD be/VB feasible/NN is/VBZ to/TO list/NN the/DT best/JJS Cze/NNP Char/NNP dishes/NNS and/CC where/WRB to/TO find/VB them/PRP instead/RB ./. So/CC I/PRP have/VBP started/VBN a/DT sort/NN of/IN Cze/NNP Char/NNP Menu/NNP in/IN our/PRP$ forum/NN where/WRB everyone/PRP can/MD give/VB their/PRP$ inputs/NN as/IN to/TO where/WRB to/TO find/VB the/DT best/JJS Hor/NNP fun/NNP ,/, Pork/NNP Ribs/NNP ,/, XO/NNP Fishhead/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN ,/, Yam/NNP Ring/NNP ,/, Har/NNP Lok/NNP Prawns/NNP and/CC so/RB on/IN ./. Do/VB join/VB in/IN and/CC add/VB your/PRP$ favorite/JJ Cze/NNP Chars/NNP onto/IN the/DT growing/NN list/NN !/. Most/JJS Cze/NNP Chars/NNP would/MD serve/VB the/DT usual/JJ Cze/NNP Char/NNP favorites/NNP like/IN sweet/JJ and/CC sour/JJ pork/NN ,/, Hor/NN Fun/NN and/CC hotplate/NN Tofu/NN ,/, but/CC there/RB seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB one/CD branch/NN of/IN Cze/NNP Char/NNP which/WDT serve/VB what/WP I/PRP term/VBP as/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP St/NNP style/NN food/NN ./. Hong/NNP Kong/NNP St/NN was/VBD famous/JJ for/IN its/PRP$ Fish/NNP Head/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN and/CC San/NN Lou/NN Hor/NN Fun/NN and/CC some/JJ Cze/NNP Chars/NNP have/VBZ made/VBD this/DT the/DT focus/NN of/IN their/PRP$ restaurants/NN ./. Why/WP this/DT should/MD be/VB so/RB I/PRP really/RB do/VBP n't/RB know/VB ,/, since/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS should/VB be/VB available/JJ at/IN any/DT Cze/NNP Char/NNP restaurant/NN ./. The/DT original/JJ Hong/NNP Kong/NNP St/NNP Cze/NNP Char/NNP is/VBZ no/RB more/JJ ,/, but/CC there/RB are/VBP some/JJ who/WP claim/VBZ direct/RB descent/JJ from/IN the/DT original/JJ stall/NN ./. The/DT most/NN famous/JJ one/CD who/WP would/MD stake/VB the/DT claim/JJ Hong/NNP Kong/NNP St/NNP Chun/NNP Kee/NNP ./. Since/CC then/RB ,/, lots/RB of/IN ``/JJ Hong/NNP Kong/NNP St/NNP ''/NNP style/NN Cze/NNP Chars/NNS have/VBP sprung/VBN up/IN using/VBG the/DT ``/JJ Hong/NNP Kong/NNP St/NNP ''/NNP name/NN ./. The/DT thing/NN that/IN attracted/NN me/PRP to/TO this/DT stall/NN is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP still/RB make/VB their/PRP$ Fish/NNP Head/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/IN the/DT traditional/JJ way/NN without/IN the/DT addition/NN of/IN milk/NN ./. The/DT way/NN to/TO do/VB this/DT is/VBZ deep/JJ fry/VB the/DT fish/NN head/NN first/JJ and/CC then/RB add/VB the/DT stock/NN in/IN a/DT quick/JJ rolling/NN boil/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO form/VB an/DT emulsion/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT case/NN with/IN the/DT fish/JJ head/NN bee/NN hoon/NN but/CC not/RB the/DT sliced/VBN fish/NN bee/NN hoon/NNS where/WRB they/PRP still/RB need/VB to/TO add/VB milk/NN to/TO give/VB it/PRP that/IN milky/NN consistency/NN ./. That/DT is/VBZ essentially/RB because/IN there/RB is/VBZ a/DT lot/RB more/JJ collagen/NN in/IN the/DT fish/NN head/NN which/WRB aids/VBZ in/IN the/DT emulsification/NN process/NN ./. I/PRP like/VB the/DT San/JJ Lou/NN Hor/NN Fun/NN here/RB as/IN it/PRP comes/VBZ with/IN a/DT bit/NN of/IN gravy/NN and/CC the/DT Hor/JJ Fun/NN is/VBZ smooth/JJ and/CC slippery/JJ ./. With/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN other/JJ stalls/NNS ,/, the/DT Hor/JJ Fun/NN tends/NN to/TO lack/VB the/DT gravy/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT stall/NN makes/VBZ theirs/RB with/IN a/DT bit/NN of/IN gravy/NN which/WDT is/VBZ very/RB nice/JJ ./. The/DT fish/NN head/NN bee/NN hoon/NN is/VBZ also/RB very/RB good/JJ though/IN I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN it/PRP could/MD have/VB had/VBD a/DT bit/NN more/NN ooomph/NN in/IN the/DT soup/NN ./. However/RB ,/, as/IN I/PRP said/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ stalls/NNS which/WRB pride/VBZ themselves/NN at/IN making/VBG it/PRP without/IN the/DT use/VB of/IN milk/NN powder/NN which/WRB I/PRP think/VB is/VBZ quite/RB commendable/JJ ./. As/CC with/IN many/JJ Cze/NNP Char/NNP stalls/NNS ,/, they/PRP have/VBN a/DT few/JJ signature/JJ dishes/NNS where/WRB everyone/NNP tends/NNP to/TO order/VB ./. One/CD of/IN them/PRP is/VBZ the/DT special/JJ pork/NN ribs/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ braised/VBN pork/NN soft/JJ bone/NN served/VBD with/IN fried/JJ Man/NN Tou/NN which/WDT is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ./. The/DT meat/NN is/VBZ braised/VBN till/NN tender/NN but/CC not/RB to/TO the/DT point/NN of/IN being/VBG dry/JJ and/CC the/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ with/IN the/DT fried/JJ Man/NN Tou/NN ./. The/DT other/JJ signature/JJ dish/NN is/VBZ their/PRP$ Prawn/NNP Rolls/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ quite/RB special/JJ as/IN they/PRP put/VB a/DT whole/JJ prawn/NN into/IN each/JJ roll/NN rather/RB than/IN mincing/VBG it/PRP ./. The/DT prawns/NNS are/VBP also/RB quite/RB large/JJ and/CC fresh/JJ so/IN each/JJ prawn/NN roll/NN is/VBZ quite/RB a/DT treat/NN ./. Conclusion/NN If/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN an/DT old/JJ school/NNP Cze/NNP Char/NNP in/IN a/DT rustic/JJ environment/NN ,/, then/RB this/DT is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ place/NN to/TO visit/VB ./. The/DT food/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ in/IN general/NN ,/, nothing/NN mindblowing/NN ,/, but/CC a/DT good/JJ place/NN to/TO gather/VB a/DT few/JJ friends/NNS and/CC have/VBN a/DT nice/JJ meal/NN and/CC reminisce/NN about/IN how/RB Singapore/NN was/VBD like/IN in/IN the/DT Seventies/NN ./. Open/JJ for/IN lunch/NN and/CC Dinner/NN daily/NN </text>
