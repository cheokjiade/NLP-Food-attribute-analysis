<title>Soya Bean Pudding Recipe: Why I don't write reviews about them</title>
<text>You/PRP may/MD have/VB noticed/VBD that/IN I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN very/RB resistant/JJ to/TO blogging/VBG about/IN Cold/JJ Soya/NN Bean/NN Curd/NN ./. The/DT reason/NN is/VBZ because/IN I/PRP feel/VB that/WDT compared/VBD with/IN traditional/JJ Soya/NN Bean/NN Curd/NN ,/, this/DT cold/JJ version/NN is/VBZ a/DT product/NN of/IN 21st/CDD century/NN food/NN technology/NN which/WRB require/VBZ little/JJ skill/NN to/TO make/VB ,/, unlike/IN the/DT the/DT traditional/JJ Soya/NN Bean/NN Curd/NN which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT art/NN that/WDT requires/VBZ years/NNS of/IN practice/NN to/TO develop/VB mastery/NN ./. That/DT is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ reason/NN why/WRB I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB blog/VB about/IN who/WP makes/VBZ the/DT best/JJ Milo/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP because/IN it/PRP really/RB is/VBZ something/NN that/WDT anyone/PRP can/MD make/VB at/IN home/NN ./. So/CC why/WRB this/DT post/NN ?/. Well/RB ,/, I/PRP just/RB wanted/VBD to/TO let/VB everyone/PRP know/VB what/WP actually/RB goes/VBZ into/IN Cold/JJ Soya/NN Bean/NN and/CC how/RB easy/VB it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO make/VB this/DT yourself/PRP! ./. Do/VB have/VB a/DT read/VB of/IN this/DT recipe/NN which/WDT I/PRP managed/VBD to/TO do/VB in/IN one/CD day/NN and/CC compare/VB it/PRP to/TO my/PRP$ traditional/JJ Tau/NN Huay/NN recipe/NN which/WRB I/PRP took/VBD months/NNS to/TO master/NN ./. I/PRP hope/VBP you/PRP will/VB appreciate/VB the/DT traditional/JJ Tau/NN Huay/IN a/DT bit/NN more/NN and/CC ask/VB yourself/PRP$ this/DT question/NN :/: ``/. Now/CC why/WRB am/VBZ I/PRP paying/NN $/$ 1.80/CD for/IN a/DT tub/NN of/IN processed/NN chemicals/NN and/CC only/RB $/$ 1/CD for/IN an/DT artisanal/JJ Tau/NN Huay/NN which/WDT takes/CD years/NNS to/TO master/NN ?/. ''/CC Now/RB you/PRP understand/VB why/WRB there/EX are/VBP so/RB many/JJ new/JJ hawkers/NNS jumping/IN on/IN this/DT cold/JJ Bean/NN Curd/NN bandwagon/NN and/CC hardly/VB any/RB who/WP are/VBP making/VBG traditional/JJ Tau/NN Huay/NN using/VBG gypsum/NN powder/NN ./. Anyway/RB ,/, a/DT friend/NN of/IN mine/PRP whom/. I/PRP met/VBD at/IN Cell/NN Group/RB brought/VBN a/DT few/JJ tubs/NNS of/IN this/DT cold/JJ bean/NN curd/NN for/IN supper/NN after/IN bible/NN study/NN ./. She/PRP had/VBD learned/VBN it/PRP in/IN a/DT cooking/NN class/NN and/CC it/PRP tasted/VBD exactly/RB like/IN those/DT Bean/NN Curd/NN that/IN you/PRP can/MD buy/VB from/IN the/DT hawker/NN stalls/NNS ,/, so/IN I/PRP asked/VBD for/IN her/PRP recipe/NN ./. The/DT most/NN difficult/JJ part/NN of/IN this/DT recipe/NN is/VBZ having/VBG to/TO buy/VB the/DT ingredients/NNS ./. You/PRP will/MD need/VB to/TO visit/VB Phoon/NNP Huat/NNP for/IN the/DT instant/JJ jelly/NN powder/NN ./. The/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS are/VBP available/JJ from/IN the/DT supermarkets/NN ./. It/PRP will/MD only/RB take/VB you/PRP 20/CD mins/NN to/TO make/VB and/CC one/CD time/NN to/IN master/NN this/DT very/RB simple/JJ recipe/NN ./. Ingredients/NNP Unisoy/NNP Soya/NNP Milk/NNP Powder/NNP 60g/NNP Polleney/NNP Soyabean/NNP powder/NN 120g/NN Coffee/NN Mate/NN 60g/NN Sugar/NN 60g/NN Poon/IN Huat/NNP Instant/NNP Jelly/NNP Powder/NNP 28g/NNP Water/NNP 1.4/NNP L/NNP Method/NNP 1/CD ./. Measure/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS 2/CD ./. Put/IN the/DT soya/JJ bean/NN powder/NN -LRB-/. both/DT Unisoy/NN and/CC Polleney/NN -RRB-/NN in/IN the/DT saucepan/NN and/CC slowly/NN pour/NN in/IN 400ml/NN of/IN water/NN ./. Use/RB a/DT whisk/NN to/TO mix/VB until/IN it/PRP becomes/VBZ a/DT smooth/JJ paste/NN ./. 3/CD ./. Turn/DT on/IN the/DT heat/NN and/CC add/VB the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT water/NN and/CC sugar/NN ./. 4/LS ./. As/IN the/DT soya/JJ milk/NN heats/NN up/NN ,/, skim/IN the/DT foam/NN off/IN the/DT surface/NN and/CC whisk/VBD the/DT mixture/NN to/TO prevent/VB it/PRP from/IN burning/NN ./. 5/LS ./. Once/RB steam/JJ starts/NNS to/TO appear/NN ,/, stir/NN in/IN the/DT Coffee/NN Mate/NN ./. 6/LS ./. Turn/JJ off/IN the/DT heat/NN -LRB-/. It/PRP should/MD be/VB about/IN 85/NN to/TO 90/CD degrees/NNS celcius/NNS at/IN this/DT point/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC stir/NN in/IN the/DT jelly/NN powder/NN 7/CD ./. Mix/RB well/RB and/CC then/RB pour/VB through/IN a/DT coffee/NN sock/NN or/CC sieve/NN 8/LS ./. Pour/JJ into/IN dessert/NN bowls/NNS 9/LS ./. Once/RB cooled/RB put/VB into/IN the/DT fridge/NN to/TO chill/VB It/PRP should/VB set/NN in/IN about/IN 1/CD hour/NN and/CC be/VB nice/JJ and/CC cold/JJ in/IN about/IN 2/CD hours/NNS ./. Notes/NNP :/: 1/CD ./. Soybean/JJ powder/NN dissolves/NN in/IN cold/JJ water/NN while/NN Coffee/NN mate/NN dissolves/NN in/IN hot/JJ water/NN ./. 2/CD ./. Do/VBP n't/RB add/VB all/DT the/DT water/NN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN as/IN it/PRP will/MD make/VB it/PRP difficult/JJ to/TO dissolve/VB ./. Much/JJ easier/NN to/TO add/VB small/JJ amount/NN of/IN water/NN first/JJ and/CC mixing/RB it/PRP into/IN a/DT paste/NN before/IN adding/VBG the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT water/NN ./. 3/CD ./. Using/VBG a/DT coffee/NN sock/NN will/MD ensure/VB that/IN your/PRP$ pudding/NN is/VBZ silky/RB smooth/JJ 4/LS ./. You/PRP can/MD reduce/VB the/DT sugar/NN to/TO suit/VB your/PRP$ own/JJ taste/NN ./. 5/LS ./. Try/VB some/DT other/JJ variations/NN but/CC using/VBG Vanilla/NN ,/, lavender/NN ,/, almond/NN essence/NNS etc/UH </text>
