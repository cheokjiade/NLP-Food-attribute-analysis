<title>Noor Jannah's Kitchen: Get ready for a Prata BOMB!</title>
<text>OK/JJ ,/, get/VB ready/JJ for/IN the/DT next/JJ revolution/NN in/IN Roti/NN Prata/NN ,/, or/CC should/MD I/PRP say/VB Roti/NN Canai/NN ?/. Ever/RB wondered/VBN if/IN there/RB is/VBZ any/RB difference/NN between/IN Roti/NN Prata/NN and/CC Roti/NN Canai/NN ?/. Most/JJS people/NN would/MD say/VB that/WDT Prata/NN is/VBZ just/RB the/DT Singapore/NN name/NN for/IN what/WP the/DT Malaysians/NN call/VBP Roti/NN Canai/NN ./. Or/CC is/VBZ it/PRP ?/. It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT while/NN since/IN I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN to/TO Malaysia/NNP ,/, but/CC I/PRP remember/VB that/WDT most/NN of/IN the/DT Roti/NN Canai/. I/PRP had/VBD there/RB was/VBD the/DT soft/JJ and/CC fluffy/JJ type/NN whereas/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, the/DT Schizophrenic/NN Prata/NN seems/VBZ to/TO come/VB in/IN many/JJ guises/NNS ./. The/DT Roti/NN Canai/NN is/VBZ actually/RB supposed/JJ to/TO be/VB different/JJ from/IN the/DT Roti/NN Prata/NN in/IN that/IN the/DT cooking/NN process/NN is/VBZ slower/JJ and/CC more/JJ laborious/NN ./. In/IN Singapore/NN ,/, where/WRB everyone/PRP is/VBZ always/RB in/IN a/DT hurry/NN ,/, the/DT prata/NN is/VBZ cooked/VBN quickly/RB by/IN using/VBG lots/NNS of/IN oil/NN ./. In/IN Malaysia/NNP ,/, where/WRB people/PRP know/VB how/WRB to/TO be/VB a/DT bit/NN more/NN laid/NN back/RB and/CC enjoy/VB life/NN ,/, they/PRP make/VB their/PRP$ Canai/NN thick/NN and/CC fluffy/JJ and/CC toast/VB it/PRP over/RB a/DT slow/JJ fire/NN with/IN very/RB little/JJ oil/NN ,/, then/RB serve/VB it/PRP with/IN sambal/NN and/CC curry/NN ./. The/DT result/NN is/VBZ a/DT pastry/NN with/IN a/DT lighter/JJ and/CC more/JJ chewy/JJ texture/NN ./. Since/IN we/PRP are/VBP celebrating/JJ National/NN Day/IN this/DT week/NN ,/, I/PRP really/RB should/VB not/RB be/VB saying/VBG this/DT ;/: but/CC when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO Roti/NN Canai/NN ,/, Malaysia/NNP really/RB Boleh/JJ ./. So/RB how/RB ?/. Does/JJ that/WDT mean/VB that/WDT we/PRP can/MD never/RB enjoy/VB a/DT good/JJ Roti/NN Canai/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ?/. Of/IN couse/NN not/RB ./. If/NNP Malaysia/NNP Boleh/NNP ,/, then/RB Singapore/NNP lagi/NNP Boleh/NNP ./. We/PRP boleh/VB hire/VB the/DT Malaysians/NN to/TO come/VB make/VB Roti/NN Canai/NN for/IN us/PRP here/RB in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. This/DT stall/NN did/VBD precisely/RB that/WDT ./. They/PRP hired/VB a/DT guy/NN who/WP had/VBD just/RB returned/JJ from/IN making/VBG Roti/NN Canai/NN in/IN Brunei/NN and/CC he/PRP brought/VBN with/IN him/PRP the/DT idea/NN of/IN the/DT Prata/NN Bomb/NN which/WDT is/VBZ currently/RB the/DT craze/VB in/IN Malaysia/NNP and/CC Brunei/NNP ./. I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ that/IN the/DT Malay/NN version/NN of/IN the/DT dough/NN is/VBZ different/JJ from/IN the/DT Indian/NN version/NN ./. The/DT dough/NN is/VBZ made/VBD with/IN extra/JJ ingredients/NNS such/JJ as/IN sugar/NN ,/, condensed/NN milk/NN and/CC eggs/NN so/IN that/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ more/RB shiok/JJ ./. The/DT Prata/NN Bomb/NN is/VBZ essentially/RB a/DT dessert/NN Prata/NN which/WDT is/VBZ something/NN like/IN a/DT Snail/JJ Pastry/NN ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ got/VBN margarine/NN and/CC sugar/NN in/IN between/IN layers/NN of/IN prata/NN dough/NN and/CC made/VBD to/TO be/VB thick/JJ and/CC fluffy/JJ ./. The/DT original/JJ Bomb/NN sold/VBD in/IN Brunei/NN where/WRB this/DT Prata/NN man/NN honed/VBZ his/PRP$ skills/NN had/VBD only/RB margarine/JJ and/CC sugar/NN ./. We/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO experiment/VB with/IN a/DT few/JJ variations/NNS on/IN this/DT ,/, so/IN we/PRP tried/VBD raisins/NN ,/, cheese/NN and/CC cinnamon/NN sugar/NN ./. -LRB-/RB Have/VB to/TO be/VB better/NN than/IN Malaysia/NNP hor/NNP ?/. -RRB-/RB We/PRP all/RB loved/VBD the/DT Raisin/NN Bomb/NN and/CC the/DT Cheese/JJ Bomb/NN ./. The/DT Cinnamon/NN Bomb/NN still/RB needed/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN tweaking/NN ./. The/DT wonderful/JJ thing/NN about/IN the/DT Bomb/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ really/RB nice/JJ and/CC crispy/JJ on/IN the/DT outside/JJ and/CC buttery/JJ and/CC fluffy/JJ within/NN ./. It/PRP might/VB be/VB the/DT same/JJ ingredients/NNS as/IN the/DT paper/NN thin/JJ Tissue/NN Prata/NN ,/, but/CC you/PRP will/VB be/VB amazed/JJ at/IN how/RB the/DT different/JJ way/NN of/IN preparing/VBG the/DT dough/NN really/RB transformed/IN the/DT taste/NN of/IN it/PRP ./. You/PRP might/VB find/VB this/DT wierd/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP goes/VBZ really/RB well/RB with/IN curry/NN and/CC I/PRP personally/VBP found/VBN it/PRP very/RB shiok/JJ with/IN a/DT cup/NN of/IN Teh/NNP Tarik/NNP ./. By/CC the/DT way/NN ,/, if/IN you/PRP really/RB want/VB to/TO eat/VB a/DT Roti/NN Canai/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD ask/VB specifically/RB for/IN ``/NN Roti/NN Canai/NN ''/NN ./. The/DT curry/NN here/RB is/VBZ very/RB shiok/JJ and/CC they/PRP also/RB serve/VB the/DT Roti/NN with/IN a/DT delicious/JJ Sambal/NNP Tumis/NNP ./. The/DT roti/NN is/VBZ nice/JJ ,/, fluffy/JJ and/CC not/RB oily/RB ,/, but/CC you/PRP will/VB have/VB to/TO wait/VB a/DT bit/NN longer/RB for/IN it/PRP ./. This/DT new/JJ stall/NN in/IN Bedok/NN has/VBZ several/RB other/JJ items/NNS that/WDT are/VBP quite/RB unique/JJ ./. One/PRP is/VBZ the/DT Soup/NN Kambing/NN Lontong/NN which/WDT is/VBZ quite/RB popular/JJ in/IN JB/JJ but/CC difficult/JJ to/TO find/VB in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. The/DT soup/NN is/VBZ not/RB thickened/JJ with/IN cornflour/NN so/IN it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB light/JJ but/CC the/DT flavor/NN of/IN the/DT soup/NN is/VBZ still/RB robust/JJ and/CC uncompromised/JJ ./. You/PRP can/MD have/VB it/PRP with/IN pressed/NN rice/NN ,/, noodles/NNS or/CC bee/JJ hoon/NN ./. One/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ Kambing/NN Soup/NN I/PRP have/VBP had/VBN for/IN a/DT while/NN and/CC it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB make/VB you/PRP feel/VB jerlak/VB afterwards/RB ./. The/DT satay/NN is/VBZ the/DT reason/NN that/IN I/PRP discovered/VBD this/DT eatery/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN pushing/IN my/PRP$ friend/NN Sha/PRP ,/, who/WP is/VBZ the/DT supplier/NN of/IN Power/NN Chicken/NN Satay/NN to/TO open/VB a/DT stall/NN in/IN the/DT East/NNP and/CC he/PRP eventually/RB managed/VBD set/NN it/PRP up/RB here/RB ./. The/DT Power/NN Chicken/NN Satay/NN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN reviewed/VBN in/IN a/DT previous/JJ blog/NN so/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB need/VB to/TO talk/VB about/IN it/PRP much/RB except/VBD to/TO let/VB you/PRP know/VB that/WDT you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VBN to/TO travel/VB all/RB the/DT way/NN to/TO the/DT West/NN to/TO try/VB this/DT now/RB ./. Conclusion/NN If/IN this/DT is/VBZ so/RB popular/JJ in/IN Malaysia/NNP ,/, it/PRP should/MD soon/RB take/VB Singapore/NN by/IN storm/NN just/RB as/IN Roti/NN Boy/NN did/VBD ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ been/VBN said/JJ before/IN that/WDT the/DT Prata/NN is/VBZ our/JJ answer/NN to/TO the/DT Croissant/NN ./. I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB think/VB it/PRP was/VBD that/RB similar/JJ until/IN now/RB ./. With/IN the/DT Prata/NN Bomb/NN ,/, we/PRP really/RB have/VB something/NN that/WDT is/VBZ comparable/JJ to/TO a/DT Croissant/NN !/. Really/PRP Must/VB Try/VB do/VB n't/RB you/PRP think/VB ?/. Just/JJ found/VBD out/IN that/IN the/DT Malaysian/JJ man/NN who/WP specializes/VBZ in/IN the/DT Prata/NNP Bomb/NNP had/VBD to/TO rush/VB back/RB to/TO Malaysia/NNP because/IN his/PRP$ wife/NN became/VBD very/RB sick/JJ ./. They/PRP have/VBP others/JJ doing/VBG the/DT Bomb/NN at/IN the/DT moment/NN but/CC I/PRP can/MD only/RB vouch/VB for/IN the/DT Bombs/NN produced/VBD by/IN this/DT guy/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP have/VBP been/VBN there/RB recently/RB ,/, please/RB let/VB us/PRP know/VB if/IN the/DT Bomb/NN was/VBD alright/RB ./. The/DT stall/NN has/VBZ relocated/VBN to/TO Bedok/VB South/DT Blk/JJ 18/NN after/IN fighting/VBG a/DT losing/JJ battle/NN against/IN the/DT authorities/NN who/WP refused/VBZ to/TO allow/VB them/PRP to/TO BBQ/NNP the/DT satay/NN outside/NN ./. The/DT new/JJ address/NN and/CC opening/VBG times/NNS are/VBP updated/VBN on/IN the/DT blog/NN ./. Now/JJ that/IN they/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO pangang/VB the/DT satay/NN properly/RB ,/, I/PRP hope/VBD that/IN they/PRP can/MD maintain/VB the/DT standards/NN of/IN the/DT satay/NN ./. The/DT stall/NN has/VBZ relocated/VBN to/TO Jalan/VB Masjid/NN in/IN Kembangan/NN and/CC their/PRP$ new/JJ premises/NNS start/VB operation/RB this/DT month/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB gone/VB down/VB to/TO check/VB them/PRP out/VB yet/RB ./. Will/JJ update/NN later/NN ./. Unfortunately/RB they/PRP no/RB longer/RB do/VB the/DT Prata/NN Bomb/NN !/. </text>
