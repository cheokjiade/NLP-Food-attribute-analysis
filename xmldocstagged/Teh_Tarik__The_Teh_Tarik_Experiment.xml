<title>Teh Tarik: The Teh Tarik Experiment</title>
<text>Remember/VBN in/IN my/PRP$ last/JJ Teh/NNP Tarik/NNP post/. I/PRP asked/VBD whether/CC ``/JJ Tariking/NN ''/IN the/DT Teh/NNP actually/RB made/VBD a/DT difference/NN to/TO the/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT Teh/NNP ?/. Well/RB ,/, I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO put/VB the/DT question/NN to/TO the/DT test/NN ./. So/RB in/IN true/JJ quasi-scientific/NN fashion/NN ,/, I/PRP put/VB the/DT question/NN through/IN a/DT totally/RB unrigorous/JJ randomised/NN uncontrolled/NN trial/NN ./. The/DT type/NN of/IN trial/NN that/WDT can/MD never/RB be/VB published/VBN in/IN any/DT respectable/JJ journal/NN ./. Here/RB then/RB is/VBZ the/DT experiment/NN :/: :/: ``/NNP Tariking/NNP ''/IN the/DT Teh/NNP actually/RB affects/IN the/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT Teh/NNP ,/, making/VBG it/PRP more/RB delectable/VBD to/TO the/DT palate/NN ./. :/: Camemberu/NNP ,/, Liverpool/NN ,/, Tag/NN ,/, iwatch_ueat/NN and/CC ieat/NN ./. Two/JJ females/NN and/CC three/CD males/NNS who/WP are/VBZ totally/RB unbiased/JJ ,/, unsuspecting/NN and/CC most/NN importantly/NN ,/, have/VBN nothing/NN to/TO gain/VB from/IN lying/VBG about/IN whether/CC Tarik/JJ or/CC No/JJ Tarik/NN is/VBZ better/NN ./. Except/RB maybe/RB for/IN Liverpool/NN who/WP as/IN you/PRP know/VB owns/VB a/DT cafe/NN and/CC he/PRP does/VBZ only/RB Teh/NNP C/NN but/CC no/DT Tarik/NN ./. He/PRP has/VBZ promised/VBN to/TO be/VB totally/RB unbiased/VBG .../: yeah/NNP right/NN ./. :/: Two/NNP cups/NNS of/IN tea/NN are/VBP prepared/VBN using/VBG a/DT common/JJ container/NN so/IN that/WDT the/DT amount/NN of/IN condensed/NN milk/NN ,/, tea/NN and/CC water/NN are/VBP the/DT same/JJ ./. One/CD cup/NN is/VBZ then/RB decanted/JJ into/IN a/DT mug/NN without/IN ``/JJ Tariking/NN ''/NN ./. The/DT other/JJ one/CD undergoes/NN three/CD Tariks/NN at/IN a/DT distance/NN of/IN a/DT man/NN 's/POS arm/NN ./. The/DT tea/NN is/VBZ than/RB decanted/JJ into/IN another/DT absolutely/RB identical/JJ mug/NN ./. The/DT subjects/NN where/RB first/JJ asked/VBD to/TO taste/VB both/DT teas/NNS with/IN their/PRP$ eyes/NN opened/VBD ./. Next/CC ,/, the/DT subjects/NN were/VBD blindfolded/RB -LRB-/JJ ok/NN we/PRP just/RB asked/VBD them/PRP to/TO closed/VBD their/PRP$ eyes/NN and/CC hope/NN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB cheat/VB -RRB-/NN and/CC asked/VBD to/TO taste/VB test/IN the/DT 2/CD cups/NNS of/IN tea/NN and/CC then/RB to/TO tell/VB the/DT rest/NN if/IN they/PRP perceive/VBD a/DT difference/NN in/IN the/DT taste/NN ./. A/DT bottle/NN of/IN mineral/NN water/NN was/VBD provided/VBD to/TO cleanse/VB the/DT palate/NN in/IN between/IN tastings/NN ./. :/: Tag/NNP was/VBD given/VBN 2/CD sips/NNS of/IN the/DT Non-Tariked/NN Tea/NN ./. He/PRP claimed/VBD that/IN the/DT first/JJ one/CD tasted/VBD better/NN then/RB the/DT 2nd/CD ./. iwatch_ueat/PRP was/VBD given/VBN the/DT Tariked/JJ one/CD first/JJ and/CC the/DT Non-Tariked/JJ one/CD 2nd/CD ./. She/JJ claimed/IN the/DT first/JJ was/VBD the/DT Non-Tariked/NN and/CC the/DT 2nd/CD one/CD the/DT Tariked/NN Camemberu/NN was/VBD similarly/RB given/VBN the/DT Tariked/JJ one/CD first/JJ and/CC non-Tariked/JJ one/CD next/JJ ./. She/DT got/VBN it/PRP right/RB the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, but/CC could/MD not/RB repeat/VB her/PRP feat/VB the/DT second/JJ time/NN ./. Liverpool/NNP was/VBD given/VBN 2/CD sips/NNS from/IN the/DT Non-Tariked/NN tea/NN ./. He/PRP said/JJ the/DT first/JJ was/VBD Tariked/JJ and/CC the/DT 2nd/CD the/DT non-Tariked/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD honest/RB enough/JJ to/TO just/RB say/VB I/PRP could/MD not/RB tell/VB the/DT difference/NN ./. There/EX is/VBZ no/RB doubt/JJ that/IN we/PRP have/VBP proven/VBN the/DT hypothesis/NN to/TO be/VB false/NN ./. ``/JJ Tariking/NN ''/IN the/DT tea/NN may/MD lower/JJR the/DT temperature/NN a/DT bit/NN and/CC make/VB lots/NNS of/IN foam/NN and/CC maybe/RB trap/VB a/DT few/JJ flying/VBG insects/NN and/CC dust/NN particles/NN in/IN the/DT process/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB significantly/JJ alter/IN the/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT Teh/NNP such/NN that/IN ordinary/NNP makankakis/NNP can/MD discern/VB the/DT difference/NN ./. Back/JJ to/TO the/DT Teh/NNP Tarik/NNP itself/PRP ./. This/DT non-descript/JJ ``/NN Hole/NN in/IN the/DT Wall/NN ''/NN little/JJ stall/NN in/IN Kampung/NN Glam/NN is/VBZ a/DT favorite/JJ amongst/NN Taxi/NN Drivers/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT convenient/NN parking/NN and/CC the/DT cheap/JJ prices/NN ./. A/DT cup/NN of/IN Teh/NNP Tarik/NNP here/RB is/VBZ still/RB only/RB 70/JJ cents/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ that/IN it/PRP was/VBD only/RB 60/CD cents/NN before/IN ,/, so/IN they/PRP might/VB have/VB increased/RB the/DT price/NN recently/RB due/JJ to/TO the/DT shortage/NN of/IN milk/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ cup/NN of/IN tea/NN ./. The/DT tea/NN was/VBD strong/JJ but/CC we/PRP felt/VBD that/IN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB creamy/JJ enough/JJ that/WDT day/NN ./. And/CC ,/, unless/IN you/PRP specially/RB ask/VB for/IN lots/NNS of/IN foam/NN ,/, the/DT Teh/NNP actually/RB only/RB goes/VBZ through/IN a/DT ``/JJ half/NN arm/NN ''/NN tarik/NN once/RB ./. Then/RB again/RB ,/, apart/RB from/IN making/VBG more/JJR foam/NNS ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB actually/RB affect/IN the/DT taste/NN that/IN much/JJ as/IN we/PRP have/VBP shown/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ experiment/NN ./. Good/JJ and/CC cheap/JJ cup/NN of/IN Teh/NNP Tarik/NNP ./. The/DT ambiance/NN of/IN this/DT unassumingly/NN quaint/NN little/JJ un-named/NN shop/NN ,/, manned/NN by/IN 2/CD elderly/NN men/NN with/IN distinguished/NN beards/NN really/RB adds/VBZ to/TO the/DT whole/JJ Teh/NNP Tarik/NNP experience/NN ./. No/JJ Name/NNP Sarabat/NNP Stall/NNP 21/NNP Baghdad/NNP Street/NNP Kampung/NNP Glam/NNP 6.30/NNP am/VBZ to/TO 12mn/VB daily/RB </text>
