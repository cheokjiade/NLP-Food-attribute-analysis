<title>Cheng Delicacies: Its what's not on the Board that matters!</title>
<text>I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB quite/RB agree/VB with/IN the/DT signboard/NN which/WRB says/VBZ that/IN this/DT restaurant/NN serves/VBZ ``/NNP Traditional/NNP ''/NNP Hainanese/NNP cuisine/NN ./. To/VBD me/PRP it/PRP was/VBD more/JJ like/IN Singapore/NNP dishes/NNS with/IN a/DT Hainanese/NNP twist/NN cooked/VBN by/IN a/DT typical/JJ Hainanese/NNP lady/NNP ./. In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT dishes/NNS have/VB been/VBN modified/JJ to/TO suit/VB the/DT new/JJ generation/NN of/IN Singaporeans/NNP ./. Take/VB for/IN instance/NN the/DT signature/JJ Chicken/NN Chop/NN ,/, curry/NN rice/NN ./. First/DT it/PRP is/VBZ Chicken/NN Chop/NN and/CC not/RB pork/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT health/NN concerns/NN and/CC the/DT chicken/NN skin/NN has/VBZ also/RB been/VBN taken/VBN off/IN ,/, again/RB because/IN of/IN health/NN concerns/NN ./. So/RB this/DT ca/MD n't/RB really/RB be/VB called/VBD ``/NN Traditional/NN ''/NN anymore/RB can/VB it/PRP ?/. But/CC anyway/RB ,/, this/DT dish/NN is/VBZ by/IN far/JJ the/DT most/JJ popular/JJ there/RB with/IN almost/RB every/DT table/NN ordering/VBG the/DT one/CD dish/NN meal/NN ./. The/DT batter/NN is/VBZ really/RB nice/JJ and/CC crispy/JJ and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ served/VBD piping/VBG hot/JJ ./. However/RB ,/, without/IN the/DT skin/NN ,/, the/DT chicken/NN tends/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT little/JJ dry/JJ ./. The/DT curry/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ and/CC aromatic/JJ and/CC reminded/VBD me/PRP a/DT little/JJ of/IN Japanese/NNP Curry/NNP ./. The/DT real/JJ gems/NNS of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN though/IN are/VBP what/WP is/VBZ not/RB found/JJ on/IN the/DT board/NN ./. The/DT lady/NN boss\/chef/NN has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT passionate/JJ cook/VB all/IN her/PRP life/NN ./. So/RB when/WRB Mr/NNP Cheng/NNP retired/NNP from/IN his/PRP$ job/NN in/IN an/DT MNC/NN ,/, he/PRP decided/VBD to/TO open/VB a/DT restaurant/NN to/TO showcase/VB his/PRP$ wife/NN 's/POS cooking/NN ./. They/PRP have/VBP regulars/VBN who/WP come/VB here/RB for/IN the/DT ``/NN off/IN the/DT board/JJ ''/NN menu/NN regularly/NN ./. One/CD of/IN the/DT ``/NN off/IN the/DT board/JJ ''/NN gems/NNS is/VBZ the/DT Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP which/WDT was/VBD very/RB very/RB shiok/JJ ./. Mrs/NNP Cheng/NNP tells/VBZ me/PRP that/IN they/PRP do/VBP it/PRP the/DT traditional/JJ way/NN without/IN the/DT use/VB of/IN thickeners/NN ./. So/CC the/DT noodles/NNS are/VBP braised/VBN in/IN the/DT stock/NN until/IN the/DT gravy/NN thickens/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT bit/NN more/NN laborious/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT result/NN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB fragrant/JJ and/CC tongue/JJ tantalizing/NN dish/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD so/RB good/JJ that/IN smart/NN and/CC I/PRP finished/VB our/PRP$ plate/NN of/IN Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP while/NN waiting/VBG for/IN Damien/NNP to/TO arrive/VB ./. Can/DT not/RB Tahan/JJ -LRB-/NN resistance/NN was/VBD futile/RB -RRB-/JJ ./. The/DT only/RB problem/NN that/IN day/NN was/VBD that/IN they/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB the/DT crispy/JJ pork/NN lard/NN ,/, or/CC else/RB it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN even/RB more/RB outstanding/JJ ./. Still/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD easily/RB the/DT best/JJS KL/NNP Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP this/DT side/NN of/IN the/DT causeway/NN ./. The/DT other/JJ ``/NN off/IN the/DT board/JJ ''/NN delicacy/NN was/VBD this/DT white/JJ braised/VBN pork/NN ./. It/PRP might/VB not/RB look/VB that/IN appetizing/NN but/CC it/PRP was/VBD heavenly/JJ ./. The/DT pork/NN was/VBD braised/VBN till/NN it/PRP was/VBD sublimely/RB smooth/JJ and/CC tender/JJ and/CC served/VBD with/IN an/DT invigorating/JJ garlic/NN and/CC vinegar/NN sauce/NN ./. Simple/JJ but/CC very/RB very/RB satisfying/JJ ./. Funny/JJ that/IN the/DT best/JJ KL/NN style/NN Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP is/VBZ found/VBN in/IN a/DT ``/NNP Traditional/NNP ''/NNP Hainanese/NNP restaurant/NN !/. We/PRP are/VBP told/JJ that/WDT there/EX are/VBP still/RB other/JJ ``/NN off/IN the/DT board/JJ ''/NN delicacies/NN that/WDT are/VBZ still/RB waiting/VBG to/TO be/VB discovered/VBD ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT regular/NN there/RB ,/, wo/RB n't/RB you/PRP let/VB us/PRP know/VB what/WP they/PRP are/VBP ?/. </text>
