<title>YY Kafei Dian: Authentic Hainanese Fare?</title>
<text>I/PRP really/RB do/VBP n't/RB know/VB why/WRB Hainanese/NNP Food/NNP has/VBZ such/RB an/DT effect/NN on/IN me/PRP ./. I/PRP am/VBP not/RB sure/VB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT nostalgia/NN attached/NN to/TO it/PRP since/IN I/PRP have/VBP so/RB many/JJ fond/NN memories/NN of/IN old/JJ Hainanese/NNP Coffee/NNP Houses/NNP like/IN Silver/NNP Spoon/NNP and/CC Cairnhill/NNP Steakhouse/NNP ./. Many/JJ Hainanese/NNP men/NNP worked/VBD on/IN ``/NNP Ang/NNP Moh/NNP ''/NNP ships/NNP where/WRB they/PRP learned/VBP how/RB to/TO cook/VB western/NN dishes/NNS ./. When/WRB they/PRP arrived/VBD in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, they/PRP modified/VBP their/PRP$ cooking/NN to/TO suit/VB our/PRP$ local/NN tastes/VBZ ./. If/IN you/PRP think/VB that/WDT fusion/NN cuisine/NN is/VBZ a/DT modern/NN phenomenon/NN ,/, then/RB you/PRP should/MD really/RB consider/VB Hainanese/NNP style/NN food/NN and/CC think/VB again/RB ./. Do/VBP n't/RB you/PRP think/VB that/WDT Hainanese/NNP Pork/NNP Chops/NN is/VBZ fusion/JJ cuisine/NN ?/. Essentially/DT it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT Pork/NNP Schnitzel/NNP seasoned/VBN to/TO suit/VB local/PRP tastes/VBZ and/CC served/VBD with/IN Pototo/NN Chips/NN and/CC Peas/NN ./. I/PRP am/VBP a/DT big/JJ fan/NN of/IN Hainanese/NNP Pork/NNP Chops/NNP ./. So/RB much/JJ so/IN that/WDT there/EX is/VBZ even/RB a/DT special/JJ label/NN for/IN this/DT particular/JJ dish/NN ./. One/CD of/IN our/PRP$ readers/NNS ,/, jcys/NN ,/, alerted/NN me/PRP to/TO this/DT particular/JJ one/CD which/WRB he/PRP described/VBZ as/IN ``/DT old/JJ fashioned/NN killer/NN ''/JJ pork/NN chops/NNS ./. What/WP I/PRP like/VB about/IN the/DT pork/NN chops/NNS is/VBZ that/RB instead/RB of/IN bread/NN crumbs/IN they/PRP still/RB use/VB the/DT crushed/NN up/IN ``/JJ Jacobs/NN ''/NN Cream/NN Crackers/NN for/IN the/DT crust/NN which/WDT is/VBZ how/RB it/PRP is/VBZ done/VBN traditionally/RB ./. This/DT really/RB makes/VBZ the/DT crust/NN just/RB that/IN much/JJ more/NN crispy/NN ./. The/DT other/JJ thing/NN I/PRP like/VB is/VBZ that/RB instead/RB of/IN using/VBG Pork/NNP Loin/NNP ,/, they/PRP use/VBP the/DT Pork/NNP Neck/NNP -LRB-/. I/PRP think/VB -RRB-/NN which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ cut/NN used/VBD for/IN Sweet/NNP and/CC Sour/NNP Pork/NNP -LRB-/NNP Ku/NNP Rou/NNP Yoke/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. This/DT cut/NN of/IN meat/NN tends/NN to/TO be/VB more/RB juicy/JJ ,/, chewy/JJ and/CC flavoursome/JJ ./. So/RB overall/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD say/VB this/DT is/VBZ one/CD Pork/NNP Chop/NNP that/WDT you/PRP 'd/MD need/VB to/TO add/VB to/TO your/PRP$ list/NN of/IN must/VB trys/NN ./. The/DT Hainanese/NNP Chap/NNP Chye/NNP here/RB is/VBZ good/JJ but/CC still/RB pales/VBD in/IN comparison/NN with/IN my/PRP$ all/NN time/NN favorite/NN over/IN at/IN Chin/NNP Chin/NNP ./. It/PRP did/VBD not/RB have/VB enough/RB of/IN the/DT cuttlefish/JJ flavor/NN which/WDT I/PRP really/RB enjoy/VB ./. The/DT Chicken/NN Rice/NN here/RB is/VBZ pretty/RB standard/JJ for/IN Chicken/NN Rice/NN nowadays/RB ./. The/DT chicken/NN is/VBZ soft/JJ and/CC succulent/JJ even/NN though/IN they/PRP cook/VB it/PRP till/IN the/DT marrow/NN is/VBZ dark/JJ red/JJ color/NN ./. That/DT really/RB gives/VBZ more/RB assurance/JJ that/IN I/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB getting/VBG salmonella/NNP poisoning/NNP after/IN eating/VBG it/PRP ./. -LRB-/DT Yeah/JJ ,/, Doctors/PRP think/VB like/VB that/IN -RRB-/NN As/IN you/PRP can/MD see/VB from/IN the/DT picture/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO cook/VB the/DT chicken/NN such/NN that/WDT there/EX is/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ layer/NN of/IN gelatine/NN under/IN the/DT skin/NN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ plus/JJ point/NN for/IN me/PRP ./. The/DT rice/NN is/VBZ good/JJ but/CC nothing/NN much/JJ to/TO rave/VB about/IN ./. One/CD of/IN the/DT dishes/NNS which/WDT we/PRP were/VBD pleasantly/JJ delighted/NN with/IN was/VBD the/DT Crispy/NNP Sotong/NNP ./. The/DT batter/NN has/VBZ a/DT very/RB nice/JJ spicy/JJ vanilla/NN flavor/NN to/TO it/PRP that/RB reminded/VBD me/PRP of/IN cereal/NN prawns/NNS ./. It/PRP goes/VBZ really/RB well/RB with/IN the/DT plain/NN Chicken/NN Rice/NN ./. Although/CC YY/NNP Kafei/NNP Dian/NNP is/VBZ probably/RB most/RB famous/JJ for/IN these/DT Soft/NNP Kaya/NN Buns/NNS ,/, there/RB are/VBP other/JJ traditional/JJ Hainanese/NNP Desserts/NNP that/IN they/PRP serve/VBP on/IN weekends/NN that/IN we/PRP did/VBD not/RB get/VB to/TO try/VB ./. One/PRP is/VBZ the/DT Arh/JJ Buah/NN which/WDT is/VBZ similar/JJ to/TO the/DT more/JJ familiar/JJ Muah/NN Chee/NN ./. Guess/WP I/PRP have/VBP to/TO make/VB a/DT return/JJ trip/NN for/IN this/DT ./. The/DT buns/NNS are/VBP all/RB baked/VBD on/IN the/DT premises/NNS and/CC are/VBP super/RB soft/JJ ./. I/PRP think/VB that/WDT for/IN these/DT type/NN of/IN buns/NNS ,/, one/CD really/RB goes/VBZ for/IN the/DT texture/NN ./. I/PRP found/VBD the/DT buns/NNS was/VBD rather/RB plain/NN and/CC the/DT crust/NN too/RB light/JJ and/CC dry/JJ for/IN me/PRP ./. It/PRP was/VBD not/RB the/DT savoury/JJ buttery/JJ style/NN buns/NNS like/IN Chin/NNP Mei/NNP Chin/NNP or/CC Gideon/NNP ./. Amagada/PRP really/RB loved/VBD it/PRP though/IN ./. It/PRP was/VBD a/DT great/JJ after/IN Church/JJ lunch/NN for/IN the/DT extended/JJ family/NN ./. We/PRP all/DT had/VBD chicken/NN rice/NN ,/, several/JJ dishes/NNS and/CC finished/VB it/PRP off/IN with/IN Kopi/NN and/CC Kaya/NN buns/NNS and/CC still/RB had/VBD change/NN for/IN $/$ 50/CD ./. When/WRB I/PRP was/VBD there/RB I/PRP spied/VBD that/IN they/PRP had/VBD a/DT Hainanese/NNP Kong/NNP Bak/NNP which/WDT looked/VBD like/IN quite/RB a/DT killer/JJ dish/NN ,/, -LRB-/NN in/IN more/JJ ways/NN than/IN one/CD -RRB-/NN and/CC one/CD of/IN the/DT guys/VBZ in/IN the/DT adjacent/JJ table/NN was/VBD raving/VBG about/IN it/PRP ./. So/RB looks/VBZ we/PRP 'll/VB be/VB back/RB one/CD of/IN these/DT days/NNS ./. </text>
