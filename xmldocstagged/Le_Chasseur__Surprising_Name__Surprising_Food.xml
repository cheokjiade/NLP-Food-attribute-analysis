<title>Le Chasseur: Surprising Name, Surprising Food</title>
<text>The/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP came/VBD across/IN the/DT name/NN ``/NN Le/NN Chasseur/NN ''/NN ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT French/NN restaurant/NN ./. Then/RB when/WRB I/PRP found/VBD out/IN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD serving/VBG local/NNP cuisine/NN ,/, I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD some/JJ French/NN way/NN of/IN saying/VBG ``/. The/DT Char/NNP Siew/NNP ''/NNP ./. Then/RB I/PRP found/VBD myself/PRP standing/VBG right/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT restaurant/NN one/CD day/NN wondering/VBG what/WP to/TO eat/VB ./. I/PRP was/VBD thinking/VBG to/TO myself/PRP that/WDT I/PRP had/VBD vaguely/RB heard/VBN of/IN name/NN before/IN but/CC after/IN peering/NN inside/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ,/, I/PRP decided/VBD to/TO cross/VB over/IN to/TO eat/VB at/IN Central/NN instead/RB ./. There/EX really/RB was/VBD nothing/NN about/IN the/DT place/NN that/WDT would/MD really/RB entice/VB you/PRP to/TO walk/VB in/IN ./. It/PRP looked/VBD just/RB like/VB any/DT other/JJ little/JJ eatery/JJ but/CC with/IN a/DT weird/JJ French/NN sounding/NN name/NN and/CC there/RB was/VBD certainly/RB no/DT Char/NNP Siew/NNP in/IN sight/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD Damien/NNP who/WP eventually/RB got/VBD me/PRP to/TO have/VB lunch/NN there/RB one/CD day/NN ./. He/PRP was/VBD absolutely/RB raving/VBG about/IN it/PRP ./. The/DT one/CD dish/NN that/IN he/PRP mentioned/VBD again/RB and/CC again/RB were/VBD the/DT BBQ/NN live/JJ prawns/NNS ./. Now/RB ,/, when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO live/JJ prawns/NNS ,/, my/PRP$ favorite/NN way/NN of/IN eating/VBG them/PRP is/VBZ just/RB plain/NN steamed/VBD with/IN black/NN soy/NN sauce/NN and/CC cut/VB chillies/NND ./. I/PRP always/RB felt/VBD that/IN BBQing/IN the/DT prawns/NNS made/VBD them/PRP a/DT tad/JJ dry/JJ ,/, although/CC I/PRP loved/VBD the/DT smell/NN of/IN the/DT char/NNP grilled/VBN prawn/NN shell/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD when/WRB we/PRP started/VBD eating/VBG the/DT prawns/NNS that/WDT I/PRP realized/VBD that/IN we/PRP were/VBD onto/IN something/NN ./. The/DT restaurant/NN owner/NN ,/, Mr/NN Andy/NN Lim/NN ,/, came/VBD out/RP to/TO tell/VB us/PRP that/WDT he/PRP only/RB brings/VBD in/IN 1/CD kg/NN of/IN these/DT prawns/NNS everyday/VBD ./. They/PRP were/VBD specially/RB ordered/VBD from/IN a/DT reliable/JJ supplier/NN and/CC delivered/NN live/JJ everyday/NN ./. These/DT were/VBD n't/RB your/PRP$ usual/JJ everyday/NN tiger/NN prawns/NNS which/WRB are/VBP reared/VBN in/IN a/DT pond/NN ./. These/DT are/VBP reared/VBN in/IN the/DT sea/NN and/CC they/PRP were/VBD not/RB easy/JJ to/TO get/VB ./. Chef/NN Andy/NN then/RB told/VBD us/PRP that/WDT each/JJ prawn/NN took/VBD one/CD minute/NN to/TO cook/VB ./. First/IN they/PRP were/VBD boiled/VBN in/IN seawater/NN for/IN 30/CD seconds/NNS ,/, then/RB brushed/VBD with/IN oil/NN before/IN grilling/NN over/IN charcoal/NN ./. The/DT oil/NN dripping/NN onto/IN the/DT charcoal/JJ produces/NN smoke/NN which/WDT flavors/NNS the/DT prawn/NN and/CC the/DT slight/JJ charring/NN of/IN the/DT legs/NNS and/CC shell/NN gives/VBZ it/PRP that/IN crispy/NN charred/NN smell/NN which/WDT what/WP we/PRP all/RB love/VB about/IN BBQ/NN seafood/NN ./. When/WRB prawns/NNS die/VB ,/, enzymes/NN from/IN digestive/NNP tract/NNP start/VB to/TO digest/VB the/DT prawn/NN immediately/NN ./. Thus/JJ ,/, the/DT way/NN to/TO tell/VB if/IN your/PRP$ prawns/NNS are/VBP live/JJ or/CC not/RB is/VBZ to/TO see/VB if/IN the/DT cephalothorax/JJ -LRB-/NN head/NN and/CC chest/NN -RRB-/NN portion/NN of/IN the/DT prawn/NN stick/NN firmly/NN to/TO the/DT tail/JJ -LRB-/NN abdomen/NN -RRB-/NN ./. With/IN dead/JJ prawns/NNS ,/, the/DT head/NN comes/VBZ off/IN easily/RB because/IN as/IN soon/NN as/IN the/DT prawn/NN dies/NN ,/, its/PRP$ digestive/JJ enzymes/NN quickly/RB eats/JJ though/IN the/DT organ/NN where/WRB they/PRP are/VBP stored/JJ and/CC they/PRP start/VB digesting/VB the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT prawns/NNS ./. This/DT explains/NN why/WRB bad/JJ prawns/NNS are/VBP mushy/JJ ./. This/DT organ/NN is/VBZ located/VBD between/IN the/DT head/NN and/CC the/DT tail/NN and/CC is/VBZ the/DT part/NN where/RB all/DT yellowish/JJ gray/NN stuff/NN is/VBZ ./. As/IN you/PRP are/VBP well/RB aware/JJ ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT tastiest/JJS part/NN of/IN the/DT prawn/NN as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ made/VBD of/IN the/DT liver/NN and/CC pancreas/NN ./. This/DT explains/NN why/WRB you/PRP always/RB need/VB prawn/NN heads/NN make/VB the/DT prawn/NN stock/NN for/IN your/PRP$ Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP or/CC Prawn/NNP Noodles/NNP ./. With/IN the/DT live/JJ prawns/NNS here/RB ,/, you/PRP can/MD easily/RB take/VB the/DT shell/NN off/IN the/DT head/NN and/CC the/DT body/NN would/MD still/VB stick/NN firmly/NN to/TO the/DT tail/JJ portion/NN ./. You/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB need/VB any/DT sauce/NN for/IN these/DT ./. Just/RB enjoy/VB the/DT natural/JJ sweetness/NN of/IN the/DT prawns/NNS with/IN that/DT smokey/JJ seawater/NN taste/NN ./. The/DT other/JJ signature/JJ dish/NN here/RB is/VBZ the/DT claypot/JJ rice/NN ./. When/WRB eating/VBG claypot/NN rice/NN ,/, you/PRP really/RB have/VB no/DT choice/NN but/CC to/TO wait/VB at/IN least/RB 20/CD minutes/NNS ./. If/IN you/PRP eat/VBP claypot/JJ rice/NN that/WDT is/VBZ served/VBD to/TO you/PRP in/IN five/CD minutes/NN ,/, that/WDT just/RB means/NN that/IN they/PRP just/RB put/VB cooked/VBN rice/NN into/IN a/DT claypot/NN ,/, pour/NN some/NN soy/NN sauce/NN and/CC cooked/VBN chicken/NN meat/NN over/IN it/PRP ,/, quickly/RB heat/NN the/DT claypot/NN to/TO char/NNP the/DT rice/NN and/CC serve/VB it/PRP to/TO you/PRP ./. A/DT proper/JJ claypot/NN rice/NN must/MD be/VB cooked/VBN from/IN raw/JJ rice/NN to/TO which/WDT chicken/NN stock/NN is/VBZ added/VBD and/CC brought/VBN to/TO a/DT boil/NN ./. It/PRP should/MD be/VB cooked/VBN over/IN charcoal/NN and/CC the/DT claypot/NN should/MD be/VB old/RB enough/RB so/IN that/WDT there/EX are/VBP small/JJ cracks/NNS through/IN which/WDT the/DT smokey/JJ charcoal/NN flavor/NN can/MD seep/VB into/IN claypot/NN to/TO impart/VB the/DT smokey/JJ flavor/NN to/TO the/DT rice/NN grains/NNS ./. The/DT other/JJ important/JJ ingredient/NN is/VBZ the/DT rice/NN and/CC here/RB is/VBZ where/RB the/DT claypot/JJ rice/NN at/IN Le/NNP Chasseur/NNP distinguishes/. itself/PRP ./. Instead/JJ of/IN using/VBG normal/JJ white/JJ rice/NN ,/, they/PRP use/VBP a/DT good/JJ quality/NN basmati/NN rice/NN so/RB that/IN the/DT grains/NNS are/VBP light/JJ and/CC separated/JJ when/WRB cooked/VBN ./. This/DT gives/VBZ it/PRP an/DT excellent/JJ texture/NN and/CC bite/VB ./. Make/RB sure/VB you/PRP stir/VB the/DT rice/NN properly/RB so/IN that/WDT there/EX is/VBZ a/DT bit/NN of/IN salted/VBN fish/JJ and/CC crunchy/JJ burnt/NN rice/NN in/IN every/RB bite/VB ./. Definitely/JJ worth/NN eating/NN ./. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD Fans/NN of/IN Ter/NNP Kar/NNP Chou/NNP -LRB-/NNP Pig/NNP Trotter/NNP in/IN Black/NNP Vinegar/NNP -RRB-/NN can/MD rejoice/VB that/WDT this/DT is/VBZ one/CD place/NN where/WRB you/PRP can/MD enjoy/VB this/DT dish/NN ./. Quite/RB a/DT few/JJ readers/NNS have/VB asked/VBD me/PRP where/WRB they/PRP can/MD find/VB this/DT particular/JJ dish/NN and/CC up/NN till/NN now/RB ,/, there/RB was/VBD n't/RB a/DT place/NN I/PRP could/MD recommend/VB ./. This/DT dish/NN is/VBZ often/RB eaten/VBD by/IN women/NN right/NN after/IN childbirth/NN because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ believed/JJ that/IN black/NN vinegar/NN is/VBZ good/JJ for/IN ridding/IN the/DT body/NN of/IN old/JJ blood/NN and/CC ginger/NN is/VBZ good/JJ for/IN getting/VBG rid/NN of/IN gas/NN and/CC bloatedness/NN ./. For/IN those/DT of/IN us/PRP who/WP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB the/DT privilege/NN of/IN giving/VBG birth/NN ,/, this/PRP might/VBD not/RB be/VB a/DT dish/NN you/PRP get/VB to/TO eat/VB often/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD thus/RB quite/RB surprised/VBN at/IN how/WRB Damien/NNP ,/, Cactuskit/NN and/CC Sumosumo/NN were/VBD raving/VBG about/IN the/DT dish/NN ./. Well/RB ,/, Cactuskit/RB has/VBZ four/VBN kids/NNS and/CC he/PRP used/VBD to/TO cook/VB this/DT for/IN his/PRP$ wife/NN during/IN confinement/NN ,/, so/RB he/PRP I/PRP can/MD understand/VB ,/, but/CC Sumosumo/NNP and/CC Damien/NNP ?/. Anyway/NNP according/NNP to/TO our/PRP$ Ter/JJ Kar/NN Chou/NN connoisseurs/NN ,/, the/DT version/NN served/VBD here/RB is/VBZ pretty/RB darn/JJ good/JJ ./. The/DT balance/NN between/IN sweet/JJ and/CC sour/NN is/VBZ just/RB nice/JJ ,/, the/DT pig/JJ skin/NN meltingly/NN tender/NN and/CC the/DT ginger/NN sucks/NN pretty/RB good/JJ ./. Now/JJ ,/, the/DT prawns/NNS take/VB one/CD minute/NN to/TO BBQ/NN ,/, but/CC if/IN you/PRP want/VB the/DT BBQ/NN cuttlefish/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD have/VB to/TO wait/VB at/IN least/RB 15/CD minutes/NNS ./. That/DT is/VBZ because/IN you/PRP need/VB a/DT slow/JJ fire/NN to/TO ensure/VB the/DT cuttlefish/NN does/VBZ not/RB get/VB tough/NN ./. Eaten/JJ with/IN just/RB the/DT homemade/NN glaze/NN ,/, you/PRP get/VB to/TO enjoy/VB the/DT natural/JJ flavor/NN of/IN the/DT cuttlefish/NN ./. I/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBD the/DT glaze/NN just/RB a/DT little/JJ sweeter/NN though/IN ./. Being/VBG Teochew/NNP ,/, Chef/NNP Andy/NNP loves/VBZ his/PRP$ Tau/NN Suan/NN ./. So/RB when/WRB he/PRP makes/VBZ his/PRP$ Tau/NN Suan/NN here/RB ,/, he/PRP wants/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT split/JJ mung/NN beans/NNS are/VBP not/RB too/RB soft/JJ or/CC too/RB hard/JJ ./. In/IN order/NN to/TO do/VB that/RB ,/, the/DT beans/NNS are/VBP first/JJ steamed/JJ and/CC then/RB kept/VBD in/IN the/DT fridge/NN until/IN you/PRP order/VB it/PRP ./. When/WRB the/DT order/NN comes/VBZ in/IN ,/, he/PRP would/MD make/VB the/DT soup/NN with/IN gula/NN melaka/NN and/CC mixe/VB the/DT beans/NNS in/IN ./. Each/JJ portion/NN is/VBZ measured/RB properly/RB so/IN that/WDT you/PRP get/VB a/DT good/JJ amount/NN of/IN beans/NNS in/IN each/JJ bowl/NN ./. Then/RB the/DT You/NNP Char/NNP Kway/NNP are/VBP toasted/JJ till/NN crispy/NN before/IN serving/VBG ./. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB of/IN any/DT other/JJ place/NN that/WDT serves/VBZ Tau/NNP Suan/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ made/VBD ala/NN minute/NN ./. 4.25/DT \//JJ 5/CD The/DT final/NN surprise/NN for/IN the/DT day/NN was/VBD the/DT Black/JJ Fungus/NN dessert/NN ./. We/PRP are/VBP all/RB used/VBD to/TO having/VBG white/JJ fungus/NN but/CC the/DT Black/JJ Fungus/NN was/VBD surprisingly/RB good/JJ !/. It/PRP is/VBZ thicker/JJ and/CC softer/JJ than/IN white/JJ fungus/NN and/CC very/RB refreshing/VBG ./. Everyone/PRP loved/VBD this/DT with/IN no/DT exception/NN ./. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD Conclusion/NN Finding/VBG gems/NNS like/IN this/DT is/VBZ what/WP the/DT blog/NN is/VBZ all/RB about/IN ./. The/DT Chef/NN is/VBZ passionate/JJ and/CC a/DT bit/NN uptight/NN about/IN doing/VBG things/NNS his/PRP$ way/NN ,/, the/DT food/NN is/VBZ great/JJ and/CC the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP very/RB reasonable/JJ ./. I/PRP visited/VBD the/DT restaurant/NN twice/NN ./. The/DT first/JJ time/NN with/IN Damien/NNP and/CC subsequently/RB we/PRP organized/VBD a/DT makan/NN session/NN for/IN 15/CD kakis/NNS ./. I/PRP can/MD confidently/VB say/VB that/WDT most/NN of/IN our/PRP$ kakis/NNS are/VBP already/RB planning/VBG their/PRP$ return/NN visit/NN ./. To/RB be/VB honest/NN ,/, not/RB every/DT dish/NN was/VBD great/JJ ./. The/DT KL/JJ style/NN Hokkien/NN mee/NN which/WDT had/VBD oysters/VBN in/IN it/PRP was/VBD disappointing/JJ as/IN it/PRP lacked/VBZ flavor/NN and/CC the/DT noodles/NNS were/VBD mushy/RB ./. The/DT oatmeal/NN tofu/NN was/VBD forgettable/JJ and/CC the/DT Lotus/JJ root/NN soup/NN was/VBD nothing/NN to/TO rave/VB about/IN ./. On/JJ the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT Salted/JJ Veg/NNP Duck/NNP was/VBD a/DT 4.25/NN \//IN 5/CD and/CC the/DT Sambal/NNP Eggplant/NNP was/VBD a/DT 4.5/NN \//IN 5/CD ,/, but/CC the/DT post/NN was/VBD already/RB getting/VBG quite/RB long/JJ so/IN I/PRP did/VBD not/RB feature/NN them/PRP ./. So/RB definitely/RB ,/, there/RB are/VBP many/JJ more/JJ hits/NN than/IN misses/NN and/CC with/IN 160/JJ items/NNS on/IN the/DT menu/NN ,/, it/PRP looks/VBZ like/IN it/PRP is/VBZ going/NN to/TO take/VB a/DT few/JJ more/NN visits/NNS before/IN we/PRP can/MD satisfy/VB ourselves/NN that/IN all/DT the/DT gems/NNS have/VB been/VBN uncovered/JJ !/. Oh/EX ,/, and/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP wondering/VBG about/IN the/DT name/NN Le/NN Chasseur/NN ,/, the/DT story/NN goes/VBZ like/IN this/DT ./. The/DT owner/NN ,/, ran/RB a/DT restaurant/NN of/IN the/DT same/JJ name/NN in/IN Mauritius/NN and/CC when/WRB he/PRP returned/VBD to/TO Singapore/NNP ,/, he/PRP decided/VBD to/TO use/VB the/DT same/JJ name/NN ./. Le/DT Chasseur/JJ means/NN ``/. The/DT Hunter/NN ''/NN in/IN French/NN ./. Owner/JJ Andy/NN Lim/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB friendly/JJ ,/, so/RB when/WRB you/PRP visit/NN ,/, just/RB mention/VB you/PRP read/VB about/IN him/PRP from/IN the/DT blog/NN and/CC he/PRP will/VB be/VB more/RB than/RB happy/JJ to/TO give/VB you/PRP a/DT running/JJ commentary/NN on/IN each/JJ dish/NN !/.
