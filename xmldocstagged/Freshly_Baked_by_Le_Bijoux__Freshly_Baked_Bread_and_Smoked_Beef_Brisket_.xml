<title>Freshly Baked by Le Bijoux: Freshly Baked Bread and Smoked Beef Brisket!</title>
<text>``/DT Give/NN us/PRP this/DT day/NN our/JJ daily/NN bread/NN ./. ''/RB I/PRP used/VBD to/TO recite/VB this/DT as/IN a/DT school/JJ boy/NN at/IN St/NNP Andrew/NNP 's/POS School/NNP almost/RB every/DT morning/NN ./. It/PRP did/VBD n't/RB make/VB much/JJ sense/NN to/TO me/PRP back/RB then/RB ,/, because/IN we/PRP ate/VBD mostly/JJ rice/NN ./. Bread/VBN in/IN the/DT 70/NN 's/POS meant/NN those/DT soft/JJ white/JJ traditional/JJ loaves/NN which/WRB they/PRP used/VBD to/TO hand/NN slice/NN in/IN front/NN of/IN you/PRP while/RB you/PRP wait/VB ./. Often/RB ,/, they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB slice/VB it/PRP completely/RB so/RB that/IN you/PRP have/VBP to/TO tear/VB it/PRP apart/RB yourselves/VBD when/WRB you/PRP got/VBD home/NN ./. They/PRP tell/VB me/PRP that/IN they/PRP do/VBP it/PRP that/IN way/NN because/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO sever/VB the/DT relationship/NN between/IN the/DT baker/NN and/CC the/DT customer/NN ./. Now/JJ that/IN I/PRP am/VBP a/DT bit/NN older/NN ,/, I/PRP begin/VBD to/TO think/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ more/RB likely/JJ because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ easier/JJ to/TO pack/NN the/DT bread/NN into/IN the/DT plastic/JJ bag/NN if/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB cut/VB it/PRP completely/RB ./. :/: -RRB-/NNP In/IN the/DT last/JJ decade/NN or/CC so/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP had/VBN a/DT bountiful/NN blessing/NN of/IN bread/NN in/IN this/DT country/NN ./. Nowadays/RB we/PRP get/VB all/DT sorts/NN of/IN different/JJ loaves/NN ./. Granted/JJ ,/, most/JJ breadficianados/NN would/MD still/RB complain/VB that/IN the/DT breads/NN in/IN France/NNS are/VBP still/RB superior/VBD to/TO what/WP we/PRP get/VBP here/RB ,/, but/CC when/WRB you/PRP think/VB about/IN what/WP it/PRP was/VBD like/IN just/RB 20/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, we/PRP certainly/RB have/VBN made/VBD huge/NN progress/NN ./. I/PRP consider/VB myself/PRP to/TO be/VB very/RB much/RB a/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT Bready/NN Bunch/NN ./. My/PRP$ venture/NN into/IN bread/NN making/VBG started/VBD when/WRB I/PRP went/VBD crazy/JJ over/IN developing/VBG the/DT perfect/JJ pizza/NN recipe/NN ./. From/IN pizza/NN ,/, it/PRP went/VBD onto/IN sourdough/NN breads/NN ,/, country/NN loaves/NN ,/, soft/JJ buns/NNS and/CC so/RB on/IN ./. Bread/RB making/VBG is/VBZ very/RB relaxing/JJ ./. I/PRP love/VBP the/DT feel/VB of/IN the/DT dough/NN in/IN my/PRP$ hands/NN and/CC the/DT sweet/JJ alcoholic/NN bouquet/NN of/IN yeast/NN and/CC bacteria/NN happily/NN being/NN fruitful/NN and/CC multiplying/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBN to/TO confess/VB though/IN ,/, that/WDT I/PRP am/VBP far/JJ from/IN being/VBG an/DT expert/JJ bread/NN maker/NN ./. Aside/RB from/IN my/PRP$ pizza/NN dough/NN ,/, the/DT rest/NN of/IN my/PRP$ bread/NN recipes/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB featured/NN on/IN this/DT blog/NN as/IN yet/RB ./. Knowing/DT how/RB difficult/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO bake/NN a/DT good/JJ loaf/NN makes/VBZ one/CD appreciate/VB what/WP bakers/NNS like/IN Audrey/PRP are/VBP doing/VBG ./. Baking/JJ bread/NN really/RB is/VBZ a/DT craft/NN of/IN passion/NN ./. They/PRP have/VBN to/TO wake/VB up/IN early/NN in/IN the/DT morning/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT dough/NN ,/, proof/CC it/PRP ,/, bake/NN it/PRP and/CC cool/VB it/PRP so/RB that/IN the/DT customer/NN has/VBZ fresh/JJ bread/NN to/TO enjoy/VB for/IN the/DT day/NN ./. There/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN quite/RB like/IN the/DT smell/NN of/IN freshly/JJ baked/VBD bread/NN and/CC it/PRP certainly/RB beats/VBZ mass/JJ market/NN bread/NNS where/WRB preservatives/NNS are/VBP added/VBD to/TO lengthen/VB its/PRP$ expiry/JJ date/NN ./. A/DT while/NN back/RB ,/, I/PRP wrote/VBD about/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN bread/NN in/IN my/PRP$ post/NN :/: ``/NNP How/WRB long/RB can/VB you/PRP keep/VB a/DT Mcdonald/NN 's/POS cheeseburger/NN in/IN the/DT tropics/NN ''/NN ./. Do/VBP n't/RB worry/JJ ,/, these/DT preservatives/NNS are/VBP not/RB harmful/JJ -LRB-/NN as/IN far/JJ as/IN we/PRP know/VBP -RRB-/JJ but/CC it/PRP does/VB help/VB you/PRP to/TO appreciate/VB a/DT freshly/JJ home/NN baked/VBD loaf/NN more/NN ./. Over/JJ at/IN Freshly/NN Baked/NN ,/, the/DT breads/NNS are/VBP ,/, as/IN the/DT name/NN suggests/NN ,/, freshly/RB baked/VBD everyday/NN ./. Not/RB only/RB that/IN ,/, they/PRP also/RB make/VB it/PRP a/DT point/NN to/TO use/VB fresh/JJ ,/, homemade/JJ ingredients/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ sandwiches/NN ./. They/PRP currently/RB have/VBN a/DT few/JJ new/JJ sandwiches/NN on/IN the/DT promotional/NN menu/NN ./. One/PRP is/VBZ a/DT smoked/VBD pulled/NN pork/NN sandwich/NN and/CC the/DT other/JJ a/DT smoked/VBD beef/NN brisket/NN sandwich/NN ./. Again/RB ,/, both/DT ingredients/NNS are/VBP made/VBD fresh/JJ by/IN a/DT local/JJ artisan/NN and/CC certainly/RB not/RB a/DT product/NN from/IN a/DT long/JJ long/JJ time/NN ago/RB ,/, in/IN a/DT place/NN far/JJ far/JJ away/RB ./. I/PRP loved/VBD the/DT Smoked/NN Beef/NN Brisket/NN sandwich/NN ./. The/DT smoked/VBD beef/NN was/VBD wonderfully/RB tender/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ and/CC the/DT melted/JJ Emmenthal/NN cheese/NN and/CC super/RB soft/JJ whole/JJ grain/NN bread/NN complemented/VBD it/PRP perfectly/RB ./. Being/VBG a/DT Chinaman/NN ,/, I/PRP still/RB prefer/VB to/TO eat/VB something/NN warm/JJ for/IN lunch/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP have/VBP never/RB been/VBN hot/JJ towards/IN cold/JJ sandwiches/NN ./. So/RB this/DT one/CD suited/NN me/PRP just/RB fine/JJ ./. The/DT pulled/NN pork/NN sandwich/NN was/VBD also/RB very/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBD it/PRP a/DT little/JJ more/JJ juicy/NN ./. The/DT homemade/NN Ciabatta/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ ./. It/PRP was/VBD light/JJ ,/, crusty/JJ and/CC fresh/JJ ./. It/PRP would/MD have/VB gone/VBN with/IN anything/NN ./. Freshly/JJ Baked/NN is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN for/IN an/DT affordable/JJ Sunday/NN brunch/NN ./. They/PRP have/VB sausage/NN and/CC egg/NN platters/NN going/NN for/IN $/$ 12.90/CD and/CC it/PRP comes/VBZ with/IN their/PRP$ freshly/JJ baked/VBD bread/NNS ./. A/DT cup/NN of/IN coffee/NN or/CC tea/NN starts/NNS from/IN $/$ 2.50/CD ,/, a/DT cappuccino/NN is/VBZ $/$ 3.80/CD and/CC a/DT croissant/NN is/VBZ $/$ 1.80/CD ./. They/PRP are/VBP currently/RB having/VBG a/DT local/JJ breakfast/NN set/NN which/WRB comprise/VBZ of/IN two/CD slices/NNS of/IN homemade/NN luncheon/NN meat/NN ,/, 2/CD eggs/NNS ,/, and/CC hae/JJ bee/NN ./. I/PRP am/VBP very/RB surprised/VBN by/IN the/DT luncheon/NN meat/NN as/IN I/PRP have/VBP never/RB had/VBD a/DT homemade/NN version/NN before/IN and/CC it/PRP was/VBD very/RB nice/JJ ./. However/RB ,/, I/PRP felt/VBD that/IN the/DT portions/NNS were/VBD a/DT little/JJ small/JJ for/IN $/$ 13.90/CD ./. I/PRP guess/VB I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB help/VB but/CC think/VB of/IN a/DT plate/NN of/IN Nasi/NNP Lemak/NNP and/CC wonder/VB why/WRB this/DT plate/NN ,/, which/WRB lacks/VBZ the/DT rice/NN is/VBZ so/RB much/JJ more/NN expensive/NNS ?/. The/DT luncheon/NN meat/NN and/CC hae/NN bee/NN do/VBP n't/RB go/VB quite/RB well/RB with/IN each/JJ other/JJ but/CC were/VBD very/RB good/JJ by/IN themselves/NN ./. My/PRP$ friend/NN ,/, Cactuskit/NNP however/NNP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ combination/NN ./. I/PRP will/VB let/VB you/PRP all/RB be/VB the/DT judge/NN ./. Conclusion/NN Unpretentious/JJ place/NN for/IN some/DT sandwiches/NN made/VBD with/IN freshly/JJ baked/VBD bread/NNS and/CC fresh/JJ ingredients/NNS ./. I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB feature/NN the/DT walnut/NN and/CC raisin/NN bread/NN in/IN the/DT post/NN ,/, but/CC that/WDT is/VBZ their/PRP$ specialty/NN and/CC one/CD of/IN their/PRP$ most/NN popular/JJ sandwiches/NN is/VBZ the/DT ham/JJ and/CC cheese/JJ sandwich/NN on/IN walnut/NN and/CC raisin/NN bread/NN ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ well/RB worth/JJ trying/VBG !/.
