<title>Bomba: The Spanish invasion</title>
<text>The/DT latest/JJS culinary/JJ trend/NN in/IN town/NN and/CC indeed/RB around/IN the/DT world/NN is/VBZ undoubtedly/JJ Spanish/NN cuisine/NN ./. In/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ,/, its/PRP$ refreshing/VBG to/TO see/VB many/JJ Spanish/NN eateries/NNS opening/VBG up/RP here/RB in/IN a/DT market/JJ saturated/NN with/IN Italian/JJ eateries/NNS ./. I/PRP have/VBP yet/RB to/TO really/RB venture/JJ into/IN Spanish/JJ cuisine/NN but/CC with/IN this/DT post/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ now/RB official/JJ that/IN I/PRP am/VBP on/IN the/DT hunt/NN for/IN the/DT best/JJ Spanish/NN food/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP !/. Bomba/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN latest/JJS Spanish/NN restaurants/NN in/IN town/NN and/CC takes/NN over/IN the/DT location/NN from/IN Graze/NN at/IN 38/NNP Martin/NNP Place/NN ./. Named/JJ after/IN the/DT Spanish/JJ rice/NN that/WDT is/VBZ used/VBD for/IN the/DT iconic/JJ Spanish/NN dish/NN ,/, paella/NNP -LRB-/NNP pa-eh-ya/NNP -RRB-/NNP ,/, the/DT food/NN at/IN Bomba/NN was/VBD so/RB impressive/JJ that/IN I/PRP am/VBP left/VBN wondering/VBG why/WRB it/PRP has/VBZ taken/VBN me/PRP so/RB long/JJ to/TO get/VB into/IN Spanish/JJ food/NN !/. There/EX are/VBP two/CD schools/NNS of/IN thought/NN when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO Spanish/VB cuisine/NN ./. You/PRP have/VB the/DT ultra/JJ modern/NN molecular/NN approach/NN made/VBD popular/JJ by/IN Ferran/NN Adria/NN who/WP almost/RB single/JJ handedly/NN propelled/NN Spanish/NN cuisine/NN to/TO worldwide/VB popularity/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB you/PRP have/VBP Chefs/VBN like/IN the/DT late/JJ Santi/NN Santa/NN Maria/NN who/WP like/VB to/TO focus/VB on/IN great/JJ ingredients/NNS cooked/VBN in/IN the/DT traditional/JJ way/NN ./. Bomba/DT belongs/NN to/TO the/DT latter/JJ category/NN but/CC French/NNP Born/NNP Chef/NNP Jean/NNP Phillippe/NNP serves/VBZ his/PRP$ traditional/JJ Spanish/NN dishes/NNS with/IN a/DT little/JJ French/NN flair/NN ./. But/CC to/TO be/VB sure/JJ ,/, this/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT fine/JJ dining/NN restaurant/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ still/RB at/IN its/PRP$ heart/NN ,/, a/DT casual/JJ place/NN where/WRB you/PRP can/MD go/VB for/IN a/DT drink/NN and/CC order/NN some/NN tapas/NN and/CC paella/NN ./. With/IN so/RB many/JJ Spanish/NNS Restaurants/IN opening/VBG in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ getting/VBG easier/NN to/TO source/VB Spanish/NN ingredients/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT boon/NN for/IN Spanish/JJ food/NN lovers/NNS ./. We/PRP were/VBD introduced/JJ to/TO the/DT Carabinero/JJ Shrimps/NNS where/WRB are/VBP stunningly/JJ Crimson/NN Red/NN in/IN color/NN raw/JJ ./. They/PRP are/VBP a/DT popular/JJ shrimp/NN in/IN Spain/NNS are/VBP are/VBP named/VBD after/IN the/DT policemen/NN who/WP used/VBD to/TO wear/VB uniforms/NN of/IN similar/JJ color/NN in/IN the/DT past/IN ./. These/DT shrimps/NNS are/VBP found/VBN in/IN brackish/NNP waters/NNP at/IN the/DT estuaries/NN before/IN the/DT river/JJ empties/NN into/IN the/DT ocean/NN and/CC the/DT natural/JJ color/NN of/IN the/DT shrimp/NN is/VBZ due/JJ to/TO the/DT plankton/NN that/IN the/DT shrimp/JJ feeds/NN on/IN ./. They/PRP are/VBP one/CD of/IN the/DT most/NN flavourful/JJ shrimps/. I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB tasted/VBD ./. The/DT briny/NN crustacean/NN flavor/NN is/VBZ so/RB strong/JJ that/IN it/PRP made/VBD my/PRP$ fingers/NN smell/NNS like/IN keropok/NN for/IN quite/RB a/DT while/NN !/. The/DT head/NN of/IN the/DT shrimp/NN is/VBZ full/JJ of/IN yummy/JJ tomally/NN -LRB-/NN liver/NN -RRB-/NN which/WDT would/MD have/VB gone/VBN so/RB well/RB in/IN a/DT paella/NN !/. These/DT are/VBP the/DT tastiest/JJS shrimps/. I/PRP have/VBP come/VBN across/IN !/. Pity/IN they/PRP are/VBP $/$ 22/CD each/JJ or/CC I/PRP could/VB be/VB quite/RB happy/JJ just/RB ordering/VBG a/DT plateful/NN of/IN these/DT to/TO enjoy/VB with/IN some/JJ beer/NN !/. -LRB-/JJ Paco/NN ,/, my/PRP$ Spanish/JJ food/NN expert/NN tells/VBZ me/PRP that/WDT these/DT are/VBP also/RB expensive/VB in/IN Spain/NNP where/WRB they/PRP can/MD fetch/VB 60/CD euros/NN per/NN kg/NN !/. -RRB-/RB If/IN you/PRP love/VBP pork/NN ,/, the/DT the/DT Secreto/NN Iberico/NN is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ treat/NN ./. Secreto/NNP Iberico/NNP literally/NNP means/VBZ the/DT ``/JJ Secret/JJ of/IN Iberico/NN ''/NN and/CC refers/NN to/TO the/DT area/NN just/RB between/IN the/DT foreleg/NN and/CC the/DT belly/NN of/IN the/DT pig/NN ./. Char/NNP Siew/NNP lovers/NNS are/VBP familiar/JJ with/IN this/DT cut/NN ./. We/PRP call/VBP it/PRP the/DT pig/NN 's/POS armpit/NN ./. The/DT cut/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ when/WRB grilled/VBN as/IN they/PRP give/VBP a/DT wonderfully/NN bouncy/NN texture/NN due/JJ to/TO the/DT intricate/JJ reticular/NN marbling/VBG of/IN the/DT meat/NN in/IN these/DT areas/NN ./. But/CC of/IN course/NN ,/, this/DT Secreto/NN Iberico/NN is/VBZ even/RB more/JJ special/JJ because/IN it/PRP comes/VBZ from/IN the/DT Pata/JJ Negra/NN or/CC black/JJ footed/NN pigs/NNS whose/IN hind/JJ legs/NNS are/VBP made/VBD into/IN Jamon/NN Iberico/NN ./. Chef/NN marinades/IN the/DT pork/NN and/CC then/RB grills/VB them/PRP over/IN charcoal/NN and/CC mesquite/NN wood/NN to/TO infused/VB it/PRP with/IN a/DT nice/JJ smokey/JJ flavor/NN and/CC serves/VBZ them/PRP pink/NN ./. He/PRP tells/VBZ me/PRP that/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT pork/NN is/VBZ so/RB good/JJ ,/, there/RB is/VBZ no/RB problem/NN in/IN eating/VBG it/PRP less/JJ than/IN well/RB done/VBN ./. The/DT pork/NN was/VBD very/RB tasty/JJ and/CC had/VBD a/DT natural/JJ sweetness/NN that/WDT hits/VBZ the/DT back/RB of/IN the/DT palate/NN and/CC lingers/NN there/RB for/IN the/DT wine/NN to/TO wash/VB it/PRP down/RB ./. The/DT texture/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ ./. Another/DT popular/JJ dish/NN for/IN tapas/NN in/IN marinated/VBD anchovies/RB served/VBD with/IN bread/NN ./. For/IN those/DT of/IN you/PRP -LRB-/VB myself/PRP included/NN -RRB-/NN who/WP are/VBZ quite/RB averse/JJ to/TO anchovies/NN ,/, these/DT are/VBP actually/RB not/RB as/IN fishy/JJ as/IN I/PRP expected/VBN ./. These/DT tasty/JJ little/JJ fish/NN are/VBZ now/RB airflown/JJ to/TO Singapore/NNP ,/, so/IN they/PRP are/VBP quite/RB fresh/JJ ./. Served/JJ with/IN diced/JJ tomato/NN ,/, olive/NN oil/NN and/CC a/DT squeeze/NN of/IN lemon/NN ,/, it/PRP really/RB makes/VBZ you/PRP feel/VB very/RB Mediterranean/RB ./. The/DT traditional/JJ dish/NN of/IN pulpo/NNP ala/NNP gallega/NNP -LRB-/NNP Galician/NNP style/NN octopus/NN -RRB-/NN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB simple/JJ dish/NN to/TO make/VB ./. Basically/RB ,/, you/PRP take/VB an/DT octopus/NN ,/, boil/CC it/PRP for/IN 45/NN mins/NN till/NN tender/NN then/RB use/VB the/DT same/JJ water/NN to/TO boil/VB some/DT potatoes/NNS ./. Then/RB just/RB slice/IN the/DT potatoes/NNS and/CC octopus/NN ,/, assemble/NN and/CC drizzle/NN with/IN some/JJ olive/NN oil/NN ,/, seasoning/NN and/CC pimento/NN ./. -LRB-/RB See/VB Mark/JJ Bittman/NN 's/POS video/NN recipe/NN -RRB-/. The/DT key/NN is/VBZ to/TO get/VB the/DT texture/NN of/IN the/DT octopus/JJ right/NN ./. It/PRP ca/MD n't/RB be/VB too/RB tough/JJ nor/NN too/RB mushy/JJ ./. Usually/DT this/DT dish/NN is/VBZ served/VBD in/IN a/DT saucer/NN with/IN the/DT sliced/VBN potatoes/NNS on/IN the/DT bottom/NN and/CC octopus/NN on/IN top/JJ ./. However/RB ,/, Chef/NN made/VBD a/DT few/JJ minor/NN modifications/NN ./. First/RB he/PRP grilled/VBN the/DT octopus/NN on/IN the/DT hotplate/JJ -LRB-/NN plancha/NN -RRB-/NN to/TO give/VB a/DT wonderful/JJ aroma/NN and/CC then/RB he/PRP serves/VBZ it/PRP on/IN a/DT bed/VB of/IN crushed/JJ ratte/NN potatoes/NNS ./. These/DT wonderfully/JJ nutty/NN and/CC buttery/JJ potatoes/NNS are/VBP a/DT favorite/JJ amongst/NN French/NN chefs/NN and/CC is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ compliment/NN to/TO the/DT octopus/NN ./. Another/JJ tapas/NNS are/VBP the/DT croquetas/NN ./. Not/RB to/TO be/VB confused/VBD with/IN croquets/NN ,/, croquetas/PRP are/VBP basically/JJ made/VBD from/IN a/DT bechamel/NN sauce/NN which/WDT are/VBP cooled/JJ first/JJ then/RB shaped/JJ and/CC coated/VBN with/IN egg/NN and/CC breadcrumbs/NN and/CC deep/VB fried/VBD ./. Between/IN the/DT Potato/NN Bomba/NN and/CC the/DT Jamon/JJ Iberico/NN croquettas/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD pick/VB the/DT latter/NN ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ crunchy/JJ on/IN the/DT outside/JJ ,/, creamy/JJ on/IN the/DT inside/JJ and/CC full/JJ of/IN that/WDT Jamon/JJ flavor/NN ./. Very/JJ easy/NN to/TO like/VB ,/, but/CC a/DT croquette/NN is/VBZ a/DT croquette/NN is/VBZ a/DT croquette/NN ./. Know/DT what/WP I/PRP mean/VB ?/. Bomba/DT prides/NN itself/PRP as/IN a/DT place/NN for/IN paella/NN ./. So/CC they/PRP insist/VBP on/IN cooking/JJ the/DT rice/NN only/RB when/WRB you/PRP order/VB rather/RB than/IN cooking/JJ the/DT rice/NN first/JJ and/CC finishing/VB it/PRP when/WRB you/PRP order/VB ./. However/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP have/VBP been/VBN to/TO Spain/NN ,/, you/PRP would/MD know/VB that/WDT a/DT proper/NN paella/NN might/VB take/VB an/DT hour/NN to/TO an/DT hour/NN and/CC a/DT half/NN to/TO cook/VB !/. That/DT is/VBZ because/IN ,/, you/PRP need/VB to/TO first/JJ prepare/VB the/DT stock/NN on/IN the/DT pan/NN and/CC then/RB put/VB the/DT rice/NN in/IN ./. In/IN order/NN to/TO shorten/VB the/DT cooking/JJ time/NN ,/, what/WP Chef/NN did/VBD was/VBD to/TO make/VB the/DT stock/NN ahead/NN of/IN time/NN ./. So/CC the/DT waiting/VBG time/NN is/VBZ between/IN 20-25mins/NN which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT amount/NN of/IN time/NN the/DT rice/NN needs/VBZ to/TO cook/VB ./. Spanish/JJ paella/NN is/VBZ different/JJ from/IN the/DT Italian/JJ risotto/NN in/IN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ left/JJ to/TO cook/VB on/IN the/DT pan/NN without/IN stirring/NN ./. Italians/JJ stir/IN their/PRP$ risotto/NN continuously/NN to/TO produce/VB the/DT starch/NN which/WDT makes/VBZ the/DT rice/NN creamy/JJ ./. Spanish/DT paella/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN is/VBZ not/RB supposed/JJ to/TO be/VB creamy/JJ ,/, but/CC dry/JJ and/CC with/IN a/DT crust/NN at/IN the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT pan/NN called/VBD the/DT soccarat/NN ./. Chef/NN is/VBZ very/RB particular/JJ about/IN the/DT soccarat/NN and/CC would/MD refuse/VB to/TO serve/VB the/DT paella/NN if/IN the/DT soccarat/NN was/VBD not/RB formed/VB properly/RB ./. The/DT Langostine/NN ,/, Squid/NN and/CC Prawn/NNP Paella/NNP has/VBZ a/DT wonderful/JJ briny/NN crustacean/NN flavor/NN coming/NN from/IN a/DT wonderful/JJ seafood/NN stock/NN with/IN Chef/NN makes/VBZ from/IN roasting/JJ prawn/NN heads/NN ./. The/DT texture/NN of/IN the/DT rice/NN a/DT little/JJ gritty/NN which/WRB I/PRP am/VBP told/JJ is/VBZ the/DT way/NN the/DT Spanish/NN like/IN their/PRP$ paella/NN ./. Personally/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD prefer/VB it/PRP to/TO be/VB just/RB a/DT little/JJ bit/NN more/RB tender/JJ and/CC chewy/JJ ./. If/IN you/PRP like/VB squid/NN ink/NN pasta/NN ,/, then/RB you/PRP will/MD enjoy/VB the/DT iconic/JJ Arroz/NN Negro/NN ./. Strictly/JJ speaking/NN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB a/DT paella/JJ even/NN though/IN it/PRP is/VBZ cooked/VBN like/IN a/DT paella/NN ./. Chef/NN tells/VBZ us/PRP$ that/WDT the/DT primary/NN difference/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ wetter/JJ and/CC does/VBD not/RB have/VB the/DT soccarat/NN ./. -LRB-/IN My/PRP$ friend/NN Paco/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN says/VBZ it/PRP does/VBZ -RRB-/. It/PRP is/VBZ essentially/RB rice/NN that/WDT is/VBZ cooked/VBN in/IN squid/NN stock/NN and/CC squid/NN ink/NN ./. This/DT dish/NN is/VBZ simple/JJ ,/, yet/RB so/RB tasty/JJ ./. The/DT squid/NN ink/NN and/CC stock/NN gives/VBZ it/PRP a/DT nice/JJ umami/NN that/WDT is/VBZ more/RB subtle/JJ than/IN the/DT seafood/NN paella/NN ,/, but/CC is/VBZ the/DT sort/NN of/IN thing/NN that/IN you/PRP can/MD take/VB small/JJ mouthfuls/NN at/IN a/DT time/NN to/TO really/RB enjoy/VB the/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT sea/NN ./. I/PRP look/VB forward/VB to/TO eating/VBG this/DT again/RB !/. Conclusion/NN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB the/DT luxury/NN of/IN having/VBG ever/RB visited/JJ Spain/NN so/IN I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB tell/VB you/PRP how/RB authentic/JJ the/DT dishes/NNS in/IN Bomba/NN really/RB is/VBZ ./. But/CC based/VBD purely/RB on/IN my/PRP$ tastebuds/NNS ,/, I/PRP found/VBD the/DT food/NN very/RB tasty/JJ and/CC well/RB executed/RB ./. I/PRP like/VB the/DT casual/JJ atmosphere/NN and/CC the/DT pricing/VBG is/VBZ reasonable/JJ considering/NN there/RB is/VBZ no/DT service/NN charge/NN ./. Bomba/RB got/VBD me/PRP all/DT excited/NN about/IN discovering/VBG more/JJR about/IN Spanish/NN cuisine/NN ./. I/PRP guess/VB that/WDT sort/NN of/IN sums/VBG it/PRP up/RB !/. Dine/JJ between/IN 6pm/NN to/TO 8pm/VB and/CC get/VB a/DT free/JJ dessert/NN for/IN every/DT two/CD diners/NNS ./. Make/DT your/JJ reservations/NN under/IN ieatishootipost/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO enjoy/VB this/PRP offer/VB ./. Valid/JJ till/NN end/NN of/IN November/NNP ./. Bomba/NNP 38/NNP Martin/NNP Road/NNP Singapore/NNP 239059/NNP 6509/NNP 1680/NNP 6pm/NN to/TO 12mn/NNP Closed/NNP Sundays/. This/DT was/VBD a/DT media/NN invited/VBD review/VB </text>
