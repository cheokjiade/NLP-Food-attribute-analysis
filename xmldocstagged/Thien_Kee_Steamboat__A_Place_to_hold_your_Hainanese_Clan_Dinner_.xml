<title>Thien Kee Steamboat: A Place to hold your Hainanese Clan Dinner?</title>
<text>Singapore/NNP 's/POS Chinese/NNP population/NN is/VBZ made/VBD up/NN of/IN 41/NN %/: Hokkien/NNP ,/, 21/NNP %/: Teochew/NNP ,/, 15/CD %/: Cantonese/NNP and/CC a/DT mere/JJ 5/CD %/: Hainanese/NNP ./. But/CC when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO food/NN ,/, the/DT Hainanese/NNP are/VBP right/JJ up/IN there/RB with/IN their/PRP$ hugely/NN popular/JJ Chicken/NN Rice/NN and/CC of/IN course/NN ,/, Singapore/NNP 's/POS favorite/NN brew/NN ,/, the/DT good/JJ old/JJ Kopi/NN and/CC Kaya/NN Toast/NN ./. Sadly/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN truly/NN authentic/JJ Hainanese/NNP Restaurants/NNS are/VBP diminishing/JJ and/CC even/RB if/IN they/PRP are/VBP still/RB around/RB ,/, the/DT food/NN seems/VBZ to/TO have/VB lost/IN its/PRP$ original/JJ taste/NN ./. Fortunately/JJ ,/, there/RB are/VBP still/RB places/NNS like/IN Thien/NNP Kee/NNP which/WDT are/VBZ still/RB run/VB by/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN Hainanese/NNP men/NNP who/WP are/VBZ still/RB trying/VBG to/TO maintain/VB the/DT old/JJ Hainanese/NNP tradition/NN ./. I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB personally/VB vouch/NN for/IN the/DT authenticity/NN of/IN the/DT food/NN here/RB ,/, since/IN I/PRP have/VBP not/RB been/VB around/IN for/IN long/RB enough/RB ,/, but/CC the/DT fact/NN that/WDT 80/CD %/: of/IN the/DT client√®le/NN here/RB are/VBP Hainanese/NNP should/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ indicator/NN of/IN its/PRP$ authenticity/NN ./. Plus/JJ ,/, I/PRP have/VBP a/DT Hainanese/NNP mother-in-law/NNP -LRB-/NNP HM-i-L/NNP -RRB-/NNP who/WP can/MD also/RB lend/VB some/DT weight/NN to/TO the/DT review/VB ./. First/JJ up/NN is/VBZ the/DT Hainanese/NNP Steamboat/NNP ./. Everyone/DT enjoyed/VBN the/DT fresh/JJ ingredients/NNS and/CC the/DT tender/JJ slices/NNS of/IN beef/NN ,/, but/CC frankly/CC I/PRP am/VBP quite/RB ignorant/JJ of/IN what/WP makes/VBZ a/DT ``/JJ Hainanese/NNP ''/NNP Steamboat/NNP Hainanese/NNP ./. Looks/VBZ like/IN any/DT other/JJ steamboat/NN to/TO me/PRP ./. Basically/RB ,/, served/VBD with/IN chicken/NN stock/NN and/CC the/DT usual/JJ raw/JJ ingredients/NNS ./. Perhaps/RB some/JJ of/IN our/PRP$ readers/NNS can/MD enlighten/VB us/PRP on/IN this/DT ?/. The/DT pork/NN chops/NNS here/RB are/VBP thickly/JJ sliced/VBN and/CC are/VBP really/RB tender/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ ./. The/DT portions/NNS are/VBP generous/JJ and/CC it/PRP still/RB comes/VBZ with/IN the/DT traditional/JJ canned/NN peas/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ missing/IN the/DT thick/JJ cut/NN potato/NN chips/NNS though/IN ./. I/PRP felt/VBD the/DT pork/NN chops/NNS could/MD still/RB do/VB with/IN a/DT bit/NN more/NN ooomph/NN ./. But/CC still/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT better/NN ones/NNS around/IN ./. In/IN trying/VBG to/TO be/VB everything/VBG Hainanese/NNP ,/, this/DT stall/NN also/RB sells/VBZ Pork/NNP Satay/NN ./. Though/CC the/DT satay/NN is/VBZ outsourced/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ made/VBD to/TO the/DT restaurant/NN 's/POS specifications/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ but/CC not/RB outstanding/JJ especially/RB compared/VBD to/TO a/DT the/DT one/CD I/PRP blogged/VBD about/IN recently/RB ./. What/WP was/VBD outstanding/JJ though/IN was/VBD the/DT chicken/NN rice/NN ./. According/VBG to/TO my/PRP$ HM-i-L/JJ the/DT rice/NN here/RB is/VBZ fragrant/JJ and/CC very/RB authentic/JJ ./. When/WRB I/PRP asked/VBD her/PRP what/WP makes/VBZ it/PRP authentic/JJ ,/, she/PRP said/JJ that/IN the/DT rice/NN was/VBD broken/JJ and/CC tasted/VBD like/IN they/PRP actually/RB dry/JJ fry/VB the/DT rice/NN before/IN steaming/VBG it/PRP with/IN chicken/NN stock/NN ./. The/DT texture/NN was/VBD a/DT little/JJ grainy/JJ but/CC very/RB fragrant/JJ ./. True/DT enough/JJ ,/, the/DT owner/NN of/IN the/DT stall/NN confirmed/NN that/WDT he/PRP still/RB insists/VBD on/IN frying/VBG the/DT rice/NN first/JJ before/IN steaming/VBG ./. The/DT chicken/NN was/VBD tender/JJ with/IN much/JJ of/IN the/DT flavor/NN came/VBD from/IN the/DT soy/NN sauce/NN that/WDT was/VBD drizzled/RB over/IN the/DT meat/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD interesting/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT way/NN they/PRP tie/VBD the/DT chicken/NN with/IN raffia/JJ string/NN so/IN they/PRP can/MD pull/VB it/PRP up/RB when/RB after/IN cooking/NN ./. One/PRP can/MD not/RB leave/VB a/DT Hainanese/NNP Restaurant/NN without/IN finishing/NN off/IN with/IN some/DT Hainanese/NNP kopi/NNP right/NN ?/. Both/JJ ieatMama/NN and/CC HM-i-L/NNS are/VBP kopi/JJ lovers/NNS and/CC both/DT gave/VBD their/PRP$ thumbs/NN up/NN for/IN the/DT kopi/NN here/RB ./. Fragrant/NNP ,/, smooth/JJ ,/, non-acidic/NN with/IN lots/NNS of/IN body/NN ./. Gulp/NNP --/NNP Smack/NNP --/NNP Ahhhh/NNP !/. Good/JJ place/NN of/IN an/DT inexpensive/JJ family/NN lunch/NN ./. The/DT parking/NN is/VBZ very/RB convenient/JJ and/CC the/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ comfortable/RB ./. Food/NNP wise/NNP ,/, not/RB any/RB single/JJ item/NN to/TO really/RB rave/VB about/IN ,/, but/CC overall/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT satisfying/JJ and/CC enjoyable/JJ meal/NN ./. </text>
