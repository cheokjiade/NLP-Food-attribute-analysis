<title>Beef Hor Fun</title>
<text>There/EX are/VBP very/RB few/JJ places/NNS that/IN specialises/NN in/IN Beef/NN Hor/NN Fun/NN ./. Come/VB to/TO think/VB of/IN it/PRP this/DT is/VBZ the/DT only/RB one/CD that/WDT I/PRP know/VB of/IN ./. Most/JJS Beef/NN Hor/NN Fun/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP are/VBP served/VBN by/IN Cze/NNP Char/NNP places/NNS ;/: like/IN the/DT one/CD I/PRP frequent/VBD at/IN Geylang/NNP Lor/NNP 9/LS -LRB-/. Niu/NNP Rou/NNP Da/NNP Wang/NNP -/: Beef/NNP King/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. Ha/JJ !/. Not/RB anymore/RB !/. There/EX is/VBZ one/CD Beef/NN Hor/NN Fun/NN stall/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ located/VBD at/IN Golden/NNP Mile/NNP Food/NNP Centre/NN ./. Just/RB look/VB at/IN their/PRP$ signboard/NN ,/, it/PRP simply/RB says/VBZ Beef/NN Hor/NN Fun/NN !/. The/DT stall/NN owner/NN was/VBD quite/RB happy/JJ to/TO share/VB with/IN me/PRP the/DT secret/NN of/IN a/DT good/JJ Beef/NN Hor/NN Fun/NN ./. First/JJ ,/, you/PRP need/VB to/TO flambe/VB the/DT Hor/NNP Fun/NNP -LRB-/NNP Wok/NNP Hei/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. That/DT gives/VBZ the/DT Hor/NN Fun/IN the/DT characteristic/NN smoked/VBD flavor/NN ./. Next/CC ,/, a/DT good/JJ beef/NN stock/NN ./. They/PRP actually/RB use/VBP beef/JJ prime/JJ ribs/NNS to/TO boil/VB into/IN a/DT special/JJ stock/NN ./. Nice/DT juicy/JJ pieces/NN of/IN marinated/VBD beef/NN cooked/VBN only/RB when/WRB you/PRP order/VB your/PRP$ plate/NN of/IN Beef/NN Hor/NN Fun/NN ./. The/DT beef/NN is/VBZ not/RB over/IN tenderised/NN and/CC just/RB nice/JJ ./. The/DT gravy/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ but/CC next/JJ time/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG to/TO suggest/VB that/IN he/PRP adds/VBZ a/DT bit/NN more/RB black/JJ beans/NNS ,/, chilli/NN and/CC black/NN peppar/NN to/TO give/VB it/PRP more/RB oomph/JJ ./. Also/JJ ,/, I/PRP will/MD request/VB a/DT bit/NN more/JJ wok/NN hei/NN ./. Too/DT bad/JJ they/PRP stopped/VBP using/VBG pork/NN lard/IN a/DT few/JJ months/NNS back/RB because/IN most/JJ customers/NNS do/VBP n't/RB want/VB it/PRP ./. They/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB what/WP they/PRP are/VBP missing/JJ ./. This/DT stall/NN has/VBZ only/RB been/VBN opened/VBD for/IN 1/CD year/NN ,/, so/RB they/PRP have/VBN not/RB had/VBD the/DT newspaper/JJ reviews/NNS yet/RB ./. But/CC with/IN this/DT standard/JJ of/IN Beef/NN Hor/NN Fun/NN ,/, they/PRP should/MD ,/, soon/NN ./. Overall/JJ ,/, a/DT very/RB satisfying/JJ plate/NN of/IN Beef/NN Hor/NN Fun/NN ./. Comparing/JJ with/IN Geylang/JJ Lor/NNS 9/LS ,/, I/PRP think/VB the/DT beef/NN here/RB is/VBZ much/JJ better/NN as/IN you/PRP can/MD actually/RB taste/VB the/DT meat/NN ./. Taste/NNP wise/NNP ,/, Geylang/NNP 's/POS still/RB got/VBD more/RB oomph/JJ ,/, but/CC with/IN my/PRP$ suggestions/NN ,/, this/DT place/NN will/MD beat/VB it/PRP ./. Price/JJ wise/NN ,/, definitely/RB cheaper/JJ ./. The/DT plate/NN above/NN costs/VBZ $/$ 5/CD and/CC feeds/VBD two/CD people/NNS adequately/RB ./. At/IN Geylang/NN you/PRP would/MD have/VB to/TO pay/VB $/$ 8-10/CD for/IN the/DT same/JJ portion/NN ./. Stall/DT owner/NN here/RB definitely/RB more/JJR accomodating/JJ and/CC friendly/JJ ./. He/PRP even/RB demonstrated/VBD his/PRP$ flambe/JJ technique/NN for/IN the/DT photoshoot/NN !/. Almost/IN the/DT best/JJ Beef/NN Hor/NN Fun/NN ,/, just/RB needs/VBZ a/DT little/JJ tweaking/NN ./. </text>
