<title>Goldhill Hakka Yong Tau Foo: At last, a YTF I yearn to eat!</title>
<text>Ever/RB since/IN I/PRP started/VBD getting/VBG serious/JJ about/IN food/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VBP learned/VBN that/IN it/PRP If/CC there/EX are/VBP people/NNS eating/VBG it/PRP ,/, then/RB there/RB must/VB be/VB something/NN good/JJ about/IN it/PRP and/CC its/PRP$ a/DT matter/NN of/IN learning/VBG to/TO appreciate/VB it/PRP ./. Take/VB for/IN instance/NN Hakka/NN cuisine/NN ,/, which/WRB I/PRP have/VB only/RB began/VBD to/TO really/RB appreciate/VB after/IN visiting/VBG Goldhill/NNP ./. In/IN particular/JJ ,/, I/PRP am/VBP talking/VBG about/IN Hakka/NN Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN ./. I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB understand/VB why/WRB people/NN would/MD make/VB such/RB a/DT big/JJ fuss/NN about/IN eating/VBG something/NN as/IN simple/JJ as/IN Bean/NN Curd/NN with/IN Fish/NN Paste/NN ,/, really/RB ,/, until/IN I/PRP tried/VBD it/PRP the/DT way/NN it/PRP should/MD be/VB served/VBD !/. And/CC I/PRP learned/VBD that/IN the/DT way/NN to/TO really/RB appreciate/VB Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN is/VBZ to/TO have/VB it/PRP piping/VBG hot/JJ after/IN blanching/VBG with/IN just/RB a/DT drizzle/NN of/IN fragrant/JJ oil/NN ./. The/DT Bean/NN Curd/NN here/RB is/VBZ excellent/JJ ./. They/PRP use/VB Silken/JJ Tofu/NN rather/RB that/IN Tau/NN Kwa/NN so/IN the/DT texture/NN is/VBZ smooth/JJ as/IN silk/NN ./. Fresh/JJ Ikan/NN Parang/NN -LRB-/NN Sai/NN Toh\/Wolf/NN Herring/NN -RRB-/NN is/VBZ filletted/JJ and/CC beaten/VBN to/TO a/DT paste/NN every/RB day/NN by/IN hand/NN and/CC used/VBD as/IN a/DT filling/NN for/IN the/DT chilli/NN ,/, bittergourd/NN ,/, tau/NN pok/NN and/CC Ngor/NN Hiang/NN ./. Those/NNS of/IN us/PRP who/WP like/IN their/PRP$ food/NN sweet/JJ will/VB really/RB appreciate/VB the/DT sweet/JJ sauce/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJS sweet/JJ sauce/NN I/PRP have/VBP tasted/VBN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ really/RB thick/JJ ,/, sweet/JJ and/CC substantial/JJ !/. Their/PRP sauce/NN is/VBZ specially/RB tweaked/VBD not/RB fresh/VB out/IN of/IN a/DT bottle/NN ./. Secret/JJ ingredients/NNS are/VBP added/VBD and/CC its/PRP$ stewed/VBD for/IN 2/CD hours/NNS ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN I/PRP am/VBP eating/VBG this/DT special/JJ dish/NN called/VBD ./. Before/IN I/PRP talk/VB about/IN the/DT dish/NN ,/, let/VB me/PRP just/RB say/VB that/IN So/NN for/IN instance/NN ,/, when/WRB you/PRP eat/VB something/NN like/IN crocodile/NN meat/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, the/DT taste/NN is/VBZ so/RB foreign/JJ that/IN you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB really/RB describe/VB it/PRP ./. So/IN your/PRP$ brain/NN compares/VBZ it/PRP with/IN something/NN that/WDT you/PRP are/VBP familiar/JJ with/IN ./. In/IN most/JJ cases/NNS it/PRP 's/POS chicken/NN ./. When/WRB I/PRP first/RB saw/VBN this/DT dish/NN ,/, -LRB-/NN Glutinous/NN Rice/NN with/IN peanuts/NNS -/: a/DT sweet/JJ dessert/NN -RRB-/NNS ./. The/DT balls/NNS were/VBD made/VBD of/IN Yam/NN and/CC rice/NN flour/NN and/CC were/VBD chewy/JJ like/IN Mua/NN Chee/NN ,/, and/CC they/PRP added/VBD some/JJ condiments/NNS on/IN top/NN ./. In/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN Mua/NN Chee/NN it/PRP is/VBZ sweetened/VBD ground/JJ peanuts/NNS ./. In/IN this/DT case/NN its/PRP$ a/DT mixture/NN of/IN fried/JJ Hae/NN Bee/NN -LRB-/IN dried/JJ prawns/NNS -RRB-/RB ,/, Salted/JJ Fish/NN and/CC Jew/NN Her/NN -LRB-/NN Dried/JJ Squid/NN -RRB-/NN ./. I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD good/JJ and/CC would/MD have/VB given/VBN it/PRP a/DT 3.75/NN ./. Then/RB Uncle/NN told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT the/DT dish/NN was/VBD the/DT ./. The/DT Cantonese/NN version/NN which/WRB I/PRP am/VBP familiar/JJ with/IN has/VBZ all/RB the/DT dried/JJ prawns/NNS ,/, chinese/NNP sausages/NNS mixed/VBD in/IN the/DT Yam/NN Flour/NN dough/NN before/IN steaming/VBG ./. With/IN the/DT Yam/NN Abacus/NN ,/, the/DT dough/NN is/VBZ rolled/VBD and/CC dimpled/VBD -LRB-/RB it/PRP does/VB look/VB like/IN the/DT beads/NNS on/IN the/DT abacus/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC the/DT ingredients/NNS are/VBP added/VBD on/IN top/NN instead/RB ./. Suddenly/RB I/PRP could/MD recognize/VB the/DT Yam/NN taste/NN in/IN the/DT dough/NN and/CC how/RB excellently/JJ the/DT crispy/NN toppings/NNS complemented/VBD the/DT dough/NN !/. It/PRP suddenly/RB became/VBD a/DT The/DT other/JJ thing/NN I/PRP learned/VBD to/TO appreciate/VB was/VBD the/DT raw/JJ fish/NN ./. I/PRP always/RB thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD because/IN it/PRP was/VBD a/DT ploy/NN to/TO spread/VB a/DT small/JJ amount/NN of/IN fish/NN meat/NN out/IN to/TO cover/VB a/DT plate/NN ./. Then/RB I/PRP found/VBD out/IN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD necessary/JJ for/IN Ikan/NN Parang/NN to/TO be/VB served/VBD this/DT was/VBD and/CC it/PRP was/VBD really/RB difficult/JJ to/TO remove/VB them/PRP ./. So/RB by/IN cutting/VBG it/PRP really/RB thin/JJ ,/, you/PRP only/RB get/VB a/DT small/JJ 0.5/NN mm/NN piece/NN of/IN bone/NN which/WRB wo/VBZ n't/RB cause/VB you/PRP to/TO rush/VB to/TO A&amp;E/NNP !/. Anyway/RB the/DT fish/NN here/RB is/VBZ fresh/JJ and/CC had/VBD no/RB fishy/JJ taste/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ served/VBD with/IN a/DT savoury/JJ sesame/NN oil/NN dressing/VBG ,/, garlic/NN ,/, ginger/NN and/CC lots/NNS of/IN spring/JJ onions/NN ./. When/WRB you/PRP bite/VB into/IN the/DT fish/NN you/PRP will/VB get/VB that/WDT bit/NN of/IN grittiness/JJ due/JJ to/TO the/DT fish/JJ bones/NNS ./. The/DT last/JJ dish/NN was/VBD the/DT steamed/JJ La/NN La/NN -LRB-/NN Clams/NNS -RRB-/RB ./. This/DT is/VBZ quite/RB a/DT simple/JJ dish/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT broth/NN is/VBZ so/RB satisfying/JJ !/. Fresh/JJ clams/NNS are/VBP put/VB into/IN the/DT steamer/NN with/IN chilli/NN and/CC ginger/NN and/CC Hua/NN Tiao/NN Jiu/NN -LRB-/IN Chinese/NNP Rice/NNP Wine/NN is/VBZ added/VBD just/RB prior/JJ to/TO serving/VBG ./. The/DT broth/NN is/VBZ slightly/RB bitter/JJ but/CC complemented/VBD by/IN the/DT natural/JJ sweetness/NN of/IN the/DT clams/NNS and/CC the/DT fragrance/NN of/IN the/DT ginger/NN ,/, garlic/NN and/CC cut/VB chillies/NND !/. If/IN you/PRP have/VBP never/RB really/RB appreciated/VBD Hakka/NN cuisine/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT place/NN to/TO start/VB !/. The/DT really/RB good/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ that/WDT because/IN less/JJ oil/NN is/VBZ used/VBD ,/, after/IN the/DT meal/NN you/PRP will/MD feel/VB comfortably/RB full/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB uncomfortably/RB bloated/VBD !/. -LRB-/NNP T3/NNP +/NNP V2/NNP .5/NNP +/NNP S2/NNP +/NNP E0/NNP .75/NNP -RRB-/. This/DT is/VBZ himself/PRP !!/. I/PRP 'm/VBP serious/JJ ./. Goldhill/NNP -LRB-/NNP Jin/NN Shan/NN -RRB-/NN is/VBZ his/PRP$ Chinese/NNP name/NN ./. His/PRP father/NN who/WP started/VBD selling/VBG Hakka/NN food/NN from/IN a/DT pushcart/NN in/IN the/DT 1940/CD 's/POS ,/, eventually/RB opened/VBD a/DT restaurant/NN and/CC named/VBD it/PRP after/IN him/PRP !/. </text>
