<text>With/IN Blind/NN date/NN ,/, island/NN ,/, holy/NN drummer/NN ,/, percussionluv/NN and/CC iwatch_ueat/NN Salted/JJ Egg/NNP Soft/NNP Shell/NNP Crab/NNP $/$ 4.90/CD 1/CD crab/NN The/DT busiest/JJS places/NNS along/IN the/DT East/NNP Coast/NNP Road/NNP stretch/NN late/NN at/IN night/NN are/VBP Astons/NNP on/IN one/CD end/NN and/CC HK/NNP Cafe/NNP on/IN the/DT other/JJ ./. These/DT places/NNS are/VBP packed/VBN even/RB after/IN 10pm/NN !/. So/RB along/IN comes/VBZ Cafe/NNP Oliv/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ strategically/RB located/VBN in/IN between/IN these/DT two/CD night/NN haunts/NNS offering/VBG Value-for-Money/NN ,/, mid-range/JJ Western/NN Food/NN right/NN up/IN till/NN Midnight/NN ./. I/PRP 'd/MD say/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ sure/JJ win/NN situation/NN as/IN long/JJ as/IN the/DT food/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ./. And/CC the/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ pretty/RB decent/JJ overall/NN with/IN a/DT few/JJ items/NNS worth/IN mentioning/NN ./. The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ the/DT Battered/NNP Soft/NNP Shell/NNP Crab/NNP with/IN Salted/JJ Egg/NN ./. Great/JJ for/IN those/RB who/WP are/VBP battling/VBG a/DT low/JJ cholesterol/NN level/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT pretty/JJ tasty/JJ morsel/NN to/TO whet/VB one/CD 's/POS appetite/NN ./. Though/CC it/PRP is/VBZ nice/JJ on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, I/PRP think/VB a/DT bit/NN of/IN seasoned/JJ Japanese/NN rice/NN or/CC other/JJ carb/NN would/MD go/VB very/RB well/RB to/TO balance/VB the/DT salty/NN savoury/NN taste/NN of/IN the/DT crab/NN and/CC salted/VBD egg/NN ./. 4\/5/NNP Pork/NNP Ribs/NNP $/$ 14.90/CD If/IN you/PRP like/VB Ribs/NNP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ one/CD that/WDT you/PRP would/MD want/VB to/TO try/VB ./. The/DT homemade/NN BBQ/NN sauce/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ and/CC the/DT ribs/NNS are/VBP cooked/VBN till/IN the/DT meat/NN is/VBZ tender/JJ and/CC separates/VBZ easily/RB from/IN the/DT bone/NN ./. Just/JJ before/IN serving/VBG ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB quickly/RB grilled/VBN so/IN that/WDT you/PRP get/VB that/IN nice/JJ chargrill/NN taste/NN ./. What/WP I/PRP find/VBP most/RB exciting/JJ is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN they/PRP use/VBP a/DT very/RB special/JJ cut/NN of/IN ribs/NNS specially/RB imported/VBN from/IN Germany/NNP which/WDT includes/VBZ the/DT soft/JJ bones/NNS at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN it/PRP ./. You/PRP can/MD see/VB just/RB how/RB long/JJ the/DT rack/NN is/VBZ ./. For/IN me/PRP THIS/DT IS/VBZ the/DT best/JJS part/NN of/IN the/DT pork/NN ribs/NNS ./. And/CC the/DT ribs/NNS are/VBP slow/JJ cooked/VBN till/NN the/DT soft/JJ bones/NNS are/VBP just/RB about/IN gelatinised/VBN so/IN the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN can/MD be/VB eaten/VBD ./. Oh/EX yes/EX ,/, this/DT bit/NN really/RB sets/VBZ it/PRP apart/RB from/IN all/DT the/DT rest/NN !/. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD Lamb/NNP Shank/NNP $/$ 14.95/CD The/DT Lamb/NNP Shank/NNP gets/VBZ my/PRP$ pick/NN for/IN the/DT Best/NN Value/NNP Lamb/NNP Shank/NNP in/IN town/NN !/. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB come/VB across/IN a/DT 600g/CD lamb/NN shank/NN for/IN less/JJ than/IN $/$ 15/CD ./. If/IN you/PRP love/VBP to/TO eat/VB lots/RB of/IN meat/NN and/CC want/VB to/TO pay/VB as/IN little/JJ as/IN possible/JJ ,/, this/DT one/CD is/VBZ for/IN you/PRP !/. The/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT stewing/NN sauce/NN is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ ,/, albeit/NN a/DT predictable/JJ ``/NN Ghoulash/NN ''/NN type/NN sauce/NN ./. The/DT meat/NN was/VBD tender/JJ but/CC we/PRP felt/VBD that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB even/RB better/RBR if/IN it/PRP was/VBD stewed/VBN just/RB a/DT little/JJ longer/RB ./. 4\/5/NNP Beer/NNP Batter/NNP Fish/NNP $/$ 10.90/CD The/DT beer/NN batter/NN fish/NN was/VBD nicely/RB done/VBN ./. I/PRP am/VBP accustomed/VBN to/TO beer/NN batter/NN being/VBG really/RB thick/JJ and/CC oily/JJ ,/, so/RB this/DT thin/JJ and/CC crispy/JJ beer/NN batter/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT surprise/NN ./. Chef/NN and/CC owner/NN Kevin/NNP Heng/NNP uses/VBZ a/DT bit/NN of/IN tumeric/JJ to/TO coat/VB the/DT fish/NN to/TO give/VB it/PRP a/DT bit/NN of/IN color/NN and/CC curry/NN flavor/NN ./. At/IN $/$ 10.90/CD it/PRP is/VBZ pretty/RB good/JJ value/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP comparing/VBG it/PRP to/TO Fish/VB &amp;/CC Co./NNP ./. The/DT fish/NN is/VBZ well/RB seasoned/JJ and/CC served/VBD with/IN potato/NN wedges/NN ./. But/CC a/DT Dory/NNP is/VBZ a/DT Dory/NNP if/IN you/PRP know/VB what/WP I/PRP mean/VB ./. So/RB do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB any/DT big/JJ surprises/NNS tastewise/RB ./. 4\/5/DT Conclusion/NN Yet/CC another/DT new/JJ cafe/NN in/IN town/NN offering/NN ``/NNP Value/NNP for/IN Money/NNP ''/NNP western/NNP food/NN ./. But/CC do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB to/TO pay/VB $/$ 6/CD for/IN a/DT main/JJ meal/NN here/RB ./. The/DT meals/NNS are/VBP a/DT little/JJ more/NN upmarket/NN but/CC we/PRP still/RB felt/VBD that/IN the/DT prices/NNS are/VBP very/RB reasonable/JJ for/IN what/WP you/PRP are/VBP getting/VBG ./. Cafe/NNP Oliv/NNP aspires/VBZ to/TO offer/VB more/RB creative/JJ fare/NN to/TO differentiate/VB itself/PRP from/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT crowd/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO see/VB Chef/NNP Kevin/NNP push/NN the/DT envelop/NN of/IN creativity/NN further/RB ./. The/DT other/JJ thing/NN that/WDT is/VBZ really/RB good/JJ is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB add/VB the/DT GST/NNP or/CC Service/NNP Charge/NNP here/RB and/CC are/VBP open/JJ till/NN 12/CD midnight/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ great/JJ to/TO see/VB the/DT trend/NN of/IN offering/NN affordable/JJ western/NN food/NN gaining/VBG momentum/NN and/CC moving/VBG upmarket/NN ./. It/PRP can/MD only/RB be/VB good/JJ news/NN for/IN all/DT of/IN us/PRP !/. Cafe/NNP Oliv/NNP 220/NNP East/NNP Coast/NNP Road/NNP 63443114/NNP 11.30/NNP am/VBZ to/TO 12mn/NNP daily/NNP Sunday/NNP :/: 8am/NNP to/TO 12mn/VB </text>
