<title>Bukit Purmei Lor Mee: Sticky, Gooey, Crunchy, Savoury, Shiokness</title>
<text>You/PRP can/MD categorize/VB hawker/NN foods/IN several/JJ ways/NN ./. You/PRP could/MD have/VB a/DT group/NN called/VBD ``/NN Superstars/NN of/IN Hawker/NN Cuisine/NN ''/NN which/WDT would/MD consist/VB of/IN foods/NN like/IN Chicken/NNP Rice/NNP ,/, Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP ,/, Laksa/NN and/CC Satay/NN where/WRB every/DT tourist/NN that/WDT comes/VBZ to/TO Singapore/NNP must/MD eat/VB ./. If/IN that/WDT be/VB the/DT case/NN ,/, then/RB the/DT next/JJ category/NN would/MD be/VB the/DT ``/JJ Unsung/NN Heros/NN of/IN Hawker/NN Cuisine/NN ''/NN which/WRB are/VBZ the/DT dishes/NNS that/IN most/JJ Singaporeans/NNS love/RB ,/, but/CC which/RB get/VB no/DT attention/NN from/IN the/DT Singapore/NNP Tourism/NNP Board/NNP ./. These/DT would/MD be/VB dishes/NNS like/IN Mee/NNP Pok/NNP Tar/NNP ,/, Wanton/NNP Mee/NNP and/CC Fish/NNP Soup/NN ./. Or/CC you/PRP could/MD categorize/VB them/PRP into/IN ``/NNP Sinful/NNP Hawker/NNP Foods/NNP ''/NN of/IN which/WDT Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP and/CC Orh/NNP Luak/NNP -LRB-/NNP Oyster/NNP Omelette/NNP -RRB-/NNP would/MD feature/NN as/IN the/DT prime/JJ culprits/NN ./. Now/RB what/WP kind/NN of/IN category/NN would/MD I/PRP place/NN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP under/IN ,/, you/PRP think/VB ?/. I/PRP guess/VB it/PRP could/MD go/VB under/IN ``/NN Less/NN popular/JJ Hawker/NN dishes/NNS with/IN long/JJ Queues/NN ''/NN ./. Under/DT this/DT category/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD also/RB put/VB dishes/NNS like/IN Satay/NN Bee/NN Hoon/NN of/IN which/WDT there/EX are/VBP a/DT few/JJ popular/JJ stalls/NN that/WDT command/VBZ super/RB long/JJ queues/NN but/CC which/WDT no/DT other/JJ hawkers/NNS seem/IN interested/NN to/TO steal/VB a/DT piece/NN of/IN the/DT pie/NN ./. Lor/NNP Mee/NNP is/VBZ not/RB one/CD of/IN those/DT dishes/NNS that/WDT I/PRP dream/VB about/IN eating/VBG frequently/NN ,/, like/IN ,/, say/VB ,/, Roti/NN Prata/NN ./. That/DT is/VBZ of/IN course/NN a/DT personal/JJ preference/NN ./. I/PRP wonder/VB if/IN there/EX are/VBP any/RB readers/NNS out/IN there/RB who/WP would/MD eat/VB Lor/NNP Mee/NNP on/IN a/DT weekly/JJ basis/NN ?/. Well/RB ,/, you/PRP might/VB if/IN you/PRP found/VBD a/DT bowl/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP as/IN good/JJ as/IN the/DT one/CD at/IN Bukit/NNP Purmei/NNP ./. The/DT beauty/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP lies/VBZ in/IN the/DT contrast/NN of/IN textures/NN ./. The/DT most/NN prominent/NN is/VBZ the/DT contrast/NN between/IN the/DT sticky/JJ ,/, gooey/JJ ,/, slimy/NN sauce/NN and/CC the/DT crunchy/JJ fried/VBD bits/NNS ./. For/INs me/PRP ,/, the/DT shiokness/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP is/VBZ nibbling/RB on/IN the/DT crunchy/JJ ,/, salty/NN ,/, savoury/NN fried/VBD nuggets/NN of/IN flavored/NN batter/NN coated/VBN in/IN the/DT slimy/NN ,/, sweet/JJ ,/, garlicky/NN ,/, sourish/NN sauce/NN ./. Ever/RB wondered/VBN what/WP those/DT frilly/JJ fried/VBD bits/NNS are/VBP ?/. The/DT closest/JJS thing/NN I/PRP could/MD compare/VB them/PRP to/TO are/VBP the/DT crunchy/JJ fried/VBD bits/NNS that/WDT go/VB into/IN Poh/NNP Piah/NNP ,/, or/CC even/RB Popcorn/VB Chicken/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT wonder/VB why/WRB I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB eat/VB Lor/NNP Mee/NNP more/JJR often/NNS !/. Sticky/JJ ,/, Gooey/NN ,/, Goodness/NN !/. Now/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB easy/JJ to/TO get/VB so/RB many/JJ textures/NNS and/CC tastes/VBZ in/IN perfect/JJ balance/NN ./. But/CC when/WRB it/PRP happens/VBZ ,/, you/PRP have/VBP a/DT bowl/NN of/IN gooey/JJ goodness/NN to/TO behold/VB ./. The/DT owner/NN ,/, Mr/NN Teo/NN ,/, somehow/NN just/RB manages/VBZ to/TO do/VB that/RB and/CC has/VB produced/VBD one/CD really/RB tasty/JJ bowl/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP ./. Unlike/IN the/DT Lor/JJ -LRB-/NN braising/NN sauce/NN -RRB-/NN of/IN Braised/NN Duck/NN where/WRB the/DT role/NN of/IN the/DT Lor/NN is/VBZ to/TO flavor/NN the/DT duck/NN ,/, the/DT Lor/NN in/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP is/VBZ the/DT main/JJ star/NN of/IN the/DT show/NN ./. Mr/NNP Teo/NNP tells/VBZ me/PRP that/IN the/DT sauce/NN made/VBD from/IN pork/NN bones/NNS ,/, spices/NNS and/CC egg/NN white/JJ and/CC is/VBZ made/VBD fresh/JJ every/DT morning/NN when/WRB he/PRP gets/VBZ to/TO the/DT stall/NN at/IN 5am/NN ./. By/CC 7.30/PRP am/VBP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ ready/JJ to/TO be/VB served/VBD ./. Aside/RB from/IN the/DT Lor/NN ,/, the/DT other/JJ two/CD ingredients/NNS which/WRB act/VBZ as/IN supporting/JJ actors/NNS are/VBP the/DT chopped/VBN garlic/NN and/CC black/NN vinegar/NN ./. The/DT vinegar/NN is/VBZ also/RB specially/RB flavored/VBD with/IN a/DT secret/NN blend/NN of/IN spices/NNS and/CC this/DT very/RB important/JJ condiment/NN gives/VBZ the/DT Lor/JJ a/DT well/RB balanced/VBN and/CC rounded/JJ taste/NN which/WDT coats/VBZ the/DT whole/JJ of/IN the/DT palate/NN ./. Now/RB ,/, here/RB is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ tip/NN for/IN those/DT who/WP are/VBP visiting/VBG the/DT stall/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ./. The/DT standard/JJ bowl/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP comes/VBZ with/IN sliced/VBN lean/NNP Lor/NNP Bak/NNP ,/, crunchy/JJ bits/NNS ,/, ngor/NN hiang/NN ,/, pork/NN chops/NNS and/CC charsiew/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP want/VB to/TO make/VB the/DT Lor/NNP Mee/NNP extra/JJ special/JJ ,/, ask/VB him/PRP for/IN his/PRP$ special/JJ stash/NN of/IN braised/VBN Pork/NNP Belly/NNP which/WRB he/PRP prepares/VBD for/IN his/PRP$ regulars/NN ./. He/PRP tells/VBZ me/PRP that/CC most/JJ people/NN nowadays/RB try/VB to/TO avoid/VB fatty/JJ meat/NN which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB he/PRP serves/VBZ the/DT lean/NN braised/VBN meat/NN ./. But/CC for/IN the/DT ultimate/JJ bowl/NN of/IN Lor/NNP Mee/NNP ,/, his/PRP regulars/VB know/VB that/IN the/DT secret/NN is/VBZ in/IN the/DT braised/VBN pork/NN belly/NN !/. Lor/NNP Mee/NNP is/VBZ a/DT Hokkien/JJ dish/NN that/IN originated/NN from/IN Xiamen/NNP in/IN Fujian/NNP province/NNP ./. When/WRB Mr/NNP Teo/NNP 's/POS father/NN arrived/VBD from/IN Xiamen/NNP in/IN the/DT 50/CD 's/POS ,/, he/PRP started/VBD selling/VBG Lor/NNP Mee/NNP because/IN that/WDT was/VBD what/WP he/PRP was/VBD familiar/JJ with/IN ./. In/IN those/DT days/NNS ,/, Lor/NNP Mee/NNP only/RB had/VBD three/CD ingredients/NNS ,/, viz/NNP shredded/VBN fish/NN ,/, belly/NN pork/NN and/CC egg/NN ./. Mr/NNP Teo/NNP tells/VBZ me/PRP that/IN the/DT Lor/NNP Mee/NNP in/IN the/DT past/IN was/VBD even/RB more/JJ sticky/NN then/RB it/PRP is/VBZ nowadays/RB !/. Wow/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ really/RB sticky/JJ !/. He/PRP and/CC his/PRP$ sister/NN took/VBD over/IN the/DT business/NN and/CC settled/NN in/IN a/DT stall/NN in/IN Tiong/NNP Bahru/NNP food/NN center/NN in/IN the/DT 70/NN 's/POS ./. Then/RB 15/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, he/PRP left/VBN the/DT stall/NN in/IN Tiong/NN Bahru/NN to/TO open/VB his/PRP$ own/JJ stall/NN in/IN Bukit/NNP Purmei/NNP ./. It/PRP is/VBZ at/IN this/DT time/NN that/IN he/PRP made/VBD the/DT crunchy/JJ bits/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO differentiate/VB himself/PRP from/IN his/PRP$ sister/NN 's/POS stall/NN in/IN Tiong/NNP Bahru/NNP ./. He/PRP also/RB stopped/VB putting/RB shredded/VBN fish/NN in/IN his/PRP$ Lor/NNP Mee/NNP because/IN there/RB were/VBD occasions/NNS when/WRB he/PRP could/MD n't/RB get/VB hold/NN of/IN the/DT freshest/JJS fish/NN ,/, so/RB he/PRP decided/VBD to/TO do/VB away/RB it/PRP it/PRP altogether/RB ./. So/RB ,/, like/IN many/JJ of/IN our/PRP$ other/JJ hawker/NN dishes/NNS ,/, our/JJ Lor/NNP Mee/NNP had/VBD its/PRP$ origins/NNS in/IN China/NNP ,/, but/CC has/VBZ sinced/RB evolved/JJ into/IN something/NN unique/NN to/TO Singapore/NNP such/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ nothing/NN like/IN the/DT version/NN you/PRP get/VB in/IN Xiamen/NNP today/NNP ./. Conclusion/NN It/PRP 's/VBZ sticky/JJ ,/, gooey/JJ ,/, crunchy/JJ ,/, savoury/NN and/CC shiok/NN !/. Need/. I/PRP say/VB more/JJR ?/.
