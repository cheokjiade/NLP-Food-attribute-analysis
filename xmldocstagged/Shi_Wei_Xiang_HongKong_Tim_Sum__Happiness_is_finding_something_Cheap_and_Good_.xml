<title>Shi Wei Xiang HongKong Tim Sum: Happiness is finding something Cheap and Good!</title>
<text>Happiness/PRP is/VBZ finding/JJ something/NN good/JJ to/TO eat/VB ./. Delight/PRP is/VBZ finding/JJ something/NN good/JJ to/TO eat/VB that/PRP is/VBZ cheap/JJ !/. What/WP can/MD be/VB better/NN then/RB to/TO enjoy/VB a/DT breakfast/NN dim/NNP sum/NNP with/IN the/DT family/NN ,/, pairing/IN your/PRP$ Siew/NNP Mai/NNP with/IN a/DT cup/NN of/IN strong/JJ kopi/NN while/NN reading/NN your/PRP$ news/NN on/IN the/DT iPad/NN ,/, and/CC still/RB spend/RB less/JJ than/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN a/DT main/JJ meal/NN at/IN a/DT restaurant/NN ?/. Interested/JJ ?/. Why/JJ of/IN course/NN you/PRP are/VBP !/. ``/DT Cheap/JJ and/CC Good/JJ ''/NN is/VBZ an/DT irresistible/JJ motivator/NN of/IN the/DT Singaporean/NN psyche/NN ./. Now/RB ,/, just/RB to/TO moderate/VB your/PRP$ expectations/NN ,/, the/DT dim/NNP sum/NNP here/RB costs/VBZ $/$ 2.40/CD a/DT basket/NN ,/, so/RB you/PRP really/RB ca/MD n't/RB compare/VB it/PRP with/IN one/CD at/IN a/DT high/JJ end/NN Cantonese/NN restaurant/NN that/WDT costs/VBZ $/$ 6.80/CD +/NN +/NN ,/, but/CC even/RB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ half/JJ as/IN good/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB worth/JJ it/PRP ./. But/CC the/DT fact/NN is/VBZ that/WDT for/IN one/CD third/IN the/DT price/NN you/PRP get/VB two/CD thirds/NNS of/IN the/DT satisfaction/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN equates/NN to/TO great/JJ value/NN ./. In/IN fact/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD very/RB pleasantly/JJ surprised/VBD with/IN the/DT Wu/NNP Kok/NNP which/WDT could/MD easily/RB hold/VB its/PRP$ own/JJ with/IN those/RB served/VBD at/IN fancier/NNP places/NNS ./. It/PRP is/VBZ crisp/JJ on/IN the/DT outside/NN ,/, the/DT yam/NN is/VBZ ``/JJ sang/NNP ''/NNP -LRB-/NNP powdery/NNP -RRB-/NNP and/CC the/DT char/NNP siew/NNP filling/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ ./. I/PRP especially/RB like/IN the/DT crunchy/JJ chopped/VBN onions/NN that/WDT give/VB it/PRP a/DT bit/NN of/IN punch/NN ./. I/PRP could/MD easily/RB eat/VB a/DT few/JJ of/IN these/DT !/. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD Its/PRP$ hard/JJ to/TO imagine/VB ,/, but/CC I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ that/WDT all/PDT the/DT items/NNS are/VBP actually/RB hand/NN made/VBD right/RB there/RB in/IN that/WDT one/CD stall/NN space/NN !/. The/DT other/JJ fried/VBD items/NNS like/IN the/DT Prawn/NNP Dumplings/NNP and/CC Prawns/NNP wrapped/NNP in/IN beancurd/NNP skin/NN are/VBP also/RB well/RB worth/IN ordering/VBG ./. One/CD thing/NN about/IN the/DT fried/JJ items/NNS though/IN ,/, it/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB piping/VBG hot/JJ in/IN order/NN for/IN it/PRP to/TO be/VB at/IN its/PRP$ crispiest/NN ./. So/RB during/IN peak/NN periods/NNS ,/, you/PRP might/VB not/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO get/VB your/PRP$ Wu/NNP Kok/NNP at/IN its/PRP$ best/JJ ./. But/CC go/VB just/RB after/IN peak/NN periods/NNS and/CC you/PRP can/MD request/VB for/IN freshly/JJ fried/VBD ones/NNS which/WRB are/VBP excellent/JJ !/. The/DT Chee/NN Cheong/NN Fun/NN is/VBZ freshly/RB steamed/VBD here/RB and/CC for/IN $/$ 2.50/CD ,/, you/PRP get/VB a/DT plate/NN with/IN 6/CD pieces/NNS ./. The/DT Cheong/NN Fun/NN is/VBZ slightly/RB thicker/JJ but/CC still/RB tender/JJ and/CC the/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ slightly/RB on/IN the/DT sweet/JJ side/NN which/WRB I/PRP find/VBP very/RB agreeable/JJ ./. 4.25/DT \//JJ 5/CD If/IN you/PRP like/VB Chicken/NN Feet/NN ,/, then/RB here/RB is/VBZ where/WRB you/PRP can/MD get/VB a/DT few/JJ talons/NN to/TO titillate/VB your/PRP$ tastebuds/NNS ./. As/IN far/JJ as/IN chicken/NN feet/NNS goes/VBZ ,/, I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB really/RB fault/VB them/PRP ./. The/DT skin/NN is/VBZ soft/JJ and/CC separates/VBZ from/IN the/DT bones/NNS easily/RB and/CC the/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ well/RB balanced/VBN ./. ./. The/DT steamed/JJ pork/NN ribs/NNS with/IN black/JJ beans/NNS were/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT disappointment/NN though/IN ./. They/PRP were/VBD slightly/RB tough/JJ and/CC chewy/JJ ./. I/PRP hope/VB it/PRP is/VBZ just/RB a/DT bad/JJ day/NN for/IN the/DT pork/NN ribs/NNS ./. 3.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD The/DT dumplings/NNS here/RB are/VBP all/RB in/IN dainty/NN bite/VB sized/VBD pieces/NN ./. Again/RB ,/, these/DT were/VBD all/DT handmade/NN in/IN the/DT stall/NN ./. As/IN a/DT whole/JJ they/PRP were/VBD all/DT very/RB good/JJ ,/, just/RB that/WDT because/IN they/PRP are/VBP smaller/JJ ,/, they/PRP were/VBD not/RB as/IN juicy/JJ as/IN if/IN they/PRP were/VBD slightly/RB bigger/JJR ./. I/PRP think/VB that/WDT dumplings/NNS ,/, like/IN sushi/NN should/MD be/VB eaten/VBN in/IN one/CD mouthful/NN ./. It/PRP should/MD be/VB just/RB the/DT right/JJ size/NN so/IN that/WDT you/PRP have/VB a/DT good/JJ mouthfeel/NN when/WRB you/PRP pop/VB the/DT whole/JJ thing/NN into/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN ./. Of/IN course/NN ,/, different/JJ people/NNS have/VB different/JJ mouthsizes/NN ,/, for/IN me/PRP I/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBD the/DT siew/NNP mai/NNP maybe/RB 20/CD %/: bigger/JJR ./. 4\/5/NNP Mr/NNP Chan/NNP learned/IN the/DT craft/NN of/IN Dim/NNP Sum/NNP from/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP Chef/NN while/NN he/PRP was/VBD working/VBG in/IN the/DT hotels/NNS in/IN Malaysia/NNP ./. He/PRP is/VBZ the/DT kind/NN of/IN hawker/NN who/WP takes/VBZ pride/VBN in/IN his/PRP$ craft/NN which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB he/PRP still/RB insists/VBD on/IN doing/VBG everything/NN himself/PRP ./. He/PRP used/VBD to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO open/VB throughout/IN the/DT week/NN but/CC now/RB ,/, because/IN of/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN helpers/NN ,/, he/PRP only/RB opens/VBD on/IN weekends/NN !/. Conclusion/NN Everyone/NN knows/VBZ a/DT good/JJ deal/NN when/WRB they/PRP see/VBP one/CD ,/, so/RB be/VB prepared/VBD to/TO wait/VB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP planning/VBG to/TO go/VB for/IN a/DT Sunday/NNP morning/NNP Dim/NNP Sum/NNP branch/NN !/. My/PRP$ advice/NN is/VBZ to/TO go/VB just/RB after/IN the/DT peak/NN period/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN you/PRP can/MD get/VB your/PRP$ dim/NNP sum/NNP straight/NNP out/IN of/IN the/DT steamer/NN and/CC freshly/RB fried/VBD !/.
