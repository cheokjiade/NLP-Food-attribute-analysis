<title>Restoran Foong Foong: Ampang Yong Tau Foo is from Ampang</title>
<text>In/IN Singapore/NN you/PRP generally/VB find/VB three/CD different/JJ styles/NN of/IN Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN ./. The/DT most/NN popular/JJ style/NN and/CC subsequently/RB the/DT style/NN found/VBD in/IN most/NN food/NN courts/NN is/VBZ the/DT type/NN where/WRB the/DT different/JJ ingredients/NNS are/VBP filled/VBD with/IN only/JJ fish/NN paste/NN ./. Then/RB there/RB is/VBZ Hakka/NN Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN and/CC what/WP sets/VBZ them/PRP apart/RB is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT they/PRP use/VBP a/DT mix/NN of/IN pork/NN and/CC fish/NN as/IN the/DT filling/NN ./. Then/RB ,/, there/RB are/VBP a/DT sprinkling/VBG of/IN shops/NN selling/VBG ``/NNP Ampang/NNP ''/NNP Yong/NNP Tau/NNP Foo/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ deep/JJ fried/VBD and/CC served/VBD in/IN a/DT platter/NN with/IN a/DT light/JJ brown/JJ gravy/NN ./. So/RB just/RB what/WP is/VBZ ``/RB Ampang/JJ ''/NN Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN and/CC which/WRB Yong/NNP Tau/NNP Foo/NNP is/VBZ the/DT original/JJ one/CD introduced/NN by/IN the/DT Hakka/NN people/NN ?/. The/DT Hakka/NN -LRB-/NN lit/NN guest/JJ people/NN -RRB-/NNS are/VBP a/DT dialect/NN group/NN who/WP migrated/VBZ from/IN Northern/NNP China/NNP down/NN to/TO the/DT Southern/NNP China/NNP region/NNP where/WRB they/PRP remain/VB as/IN ``/JJ guests/NN ''/NN ,/, not/RB having/VBG a/DT permanent/JJ place/NN to/TO call/VBP home/NN ./. Being/NN Northerners/NN ,/, they/PRP are/VBP accustomed/VBN to/TO having/VBG Pau/NNP -LRB-/NNP steamed/VBD buns/NNS -RRB-/VBD as/IN a/DT staple/NN ./. But/CC down/VB South/IN they/PRP are/VBP unable/JJ to/TO get/VB hold/NN of/IN wheatflor/NN ,/, so/IN they/PRP ended/VBP up/RB stuffing/VBG meat/NN into/IN beancurd/NN instead/RB ./. Thus/DT was/VBD born/VBD the/DT Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN ./. The/DT traditional/JJ Hakka/NN Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN is/VBZ thus/RB a/DT very/RB simple/JJ dish/NN of/IN stuffed/NN Tofu/NN which/WDT is/VBZ first/RB deep/JJ fried/VBD then/RB braised/VBN ./. Along/IN the/DT way/NN ,/, other/JJ ingredients/NNS such/JJ as/IN eggplant/NN ,/, bittergourd/NN and/CC chillies/NND got/VBD stuffed/NN with/IN the/DT same/JJ filling/NN of/IN minced/NN pork/NN ,/, fish/NN paste/NN and/CC salted/VBD fish/NN ./. This/DT being/VBG the/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT Ampang/JJ style/NN Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN sounds/NN like/IN it/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB close/JJ to/TO the/DT traditional/JJ style/NN in/IN the/DT sense/NN that/IN the/DT items/NNS are/VBP fried/VBN and/CC then/RB a/DT braising/NN sauce/NN is/VBZ poured/JJ over/IN the/DT pieces/NN ./. You/PRP realize/VB of/IN course/NN that/IN Ampang/NN Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN is/VBZ called/VBD Ampang/NN Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN because/IN it/PRP originated/VBD in/IN a/DT place/NN called/VBD Ampang/NN in/IN Kuala/NN Lumpur/NN ,/, right/NN ?/. Apparently/RB it/PRP all/RB started/VBD in/IN the/DT 60/CD 's/POS with/IN a/DT stall/NN called/VBD Chew/NN Kuan/NN ./. But/CC their/PRP$ style/NN of/IN selling/VBG Hakka/NNP Yong/NNP Tau/NNP Foo/NNP grew/VBD so/RB popular/JJ that/IN it/PRP gave/VBD rise/NN to/IN other/JJ copy/NN cat/NN restaurants/NN ./. Ironically/JJ ,/, Chew/JJ Kuan/NN is/VBZ not/RB longer/RB around/IN ,/, but/CC the/DT other/JJ restaurants/NNS are/VBP ./. The/DT most/NN popular/JJ one/CD being/NN Foong/NN Foong/NN which/WDT in/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ right/NN has/VBZ established/VBN itself/PRP as/IN a/DT Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN powerhouse/NN ,/, having/VBG been/VBN in/IN business/NN for/IN over/IN 30/CD years/NNS ./. It/PRP was/VBD amazing/IN the/DT so/RB the/DT Yong/NNP Tau/NNP Foo/NNP ``/NNP factory/NNP ''/NNP in/IN action/NN ./. There/EX were/VBD ladies/NNS ,/, busily/RB ``/JJ Ngionging/NNP ''/NNP -LRB-/NNP Niong/NNP -/: to/TO fill/VB ,/, in/IN Hakka/NN -RRB-/NN tofu/NN and/CC chillies/NND ./. You/PRP place/NN your/PRP$ order/NN at/IN the/DT counter/NN ,/, the/DT boss/JJ writes/NN down/IN your/PRP$ order/NN in/IN an/DT old/JJ book/NN ,/, shouts/IN your/PRP$ order/NN and/CC mysteriously/VBD a/DT plate/NN of/IN Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN appears/NN at/IN your/PRP$ table/NN ./. How/WRB does/VBZ he/PRP do/VB that/WDT without/IN table/NNP numbers/NNP ?/. One/CD thing/NN I/PRP would/MD say/VB about/IN the/DT Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP are/VBP very/RB generous/JJ with/IN the/DT filling/NN ./. Each/DT one/CD was/VBD bursting/RB with/IN the/DT meat/NN and/CC fish/NN paste/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB quite/RB bowled/JJ over/IN my/PRP$ the/DT filling/NN though/IN ,/, as/IN I/PRP was/VBD expecting/VBG the/DT flavors/NNS to/TO be/VB more/JJR powerful/NNS ./. A/DT good/JJ Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN filling/NN should/MD have/VB a/DT punchy/JJ umami/NN coming/NN from/IN either/JJ salted/VBD fish/NN ,/, crispy/NN fried/VBD sole/NN fish/NN or/CC both/DT ./. I/PRP could/MD n't/RB detect/VB much/RB of/IN the/DT solefish/NN and/CC the/DT texture/NN was/VBD quite/RB firm/JJ ,/, rather/RB than/IN being/VBG tender/NN and/CC bouncy/NN ./. Still/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ much/JJ better/NN than/IN the/DT plain/NN fish/NN paste/NN that/IN we/PRP get/VBP at/IN most/NN stalls/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. The/DT other/JJ thing/NN about/IN Ampang/JJ style/NN Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN is/VBZ the/DT braising/NN sauce/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB really/RB impressed/VB with/IN it/PRP either/RB ./. It/PRP looked/VBD and/CC tasted/VBD like/IN just/RB some/JJ gravy/NN made/VBD with/IN soya/NN sauce/NN ./. The/DT taste/NN was/VBD n't/RB distinct/JJ nor/NN was/VBD it/PRP addictive/RB ./. Conclusion/NN It/PRP was/VBD a/DT good/JJ Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN experience/NN and/CC I/PRP would/MD probably/RB go/VB back/RB to/TO Ampang/VB again/RB just/RB to/TO eat/VB Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN ,/, but/CC perhaps/RB I/PRP would/MD choose/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT other/JJ stalls/NNS next/JJ time/NN ./. The/DT Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN at/IN Foong/NN Foong/NN is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP still/RB left/VBN me/PRP with/IN the/DT impression/NN that/IN it/PRP could/MD ,/, or/CC should/MD ,/, be/VB better/NN ./.
