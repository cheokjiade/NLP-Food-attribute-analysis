<title>Soulout: A Ulu Place to Chill out</title>
<text>This/DT place/NN is/VBZ closed/VBD Its/PRP$ hard/JJ to/TO imagine/VB Singapore/NNP having/VBG farms/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP do/VB have/VB small/JJ pockets/NN of/IN land/NN in/IN our/PRP$ tiny/JJ island/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN set/NN aside/NN for/IN agriculture/NN ./. They/PRP do/VBP n't/RB produce/VB enough/JJ food/NN to/TO feed/VB all/DT of/IN us/PRP ,/, but/CC its/PRP$ nice/JJ to/TO know/VB that/WDT there/EX are/VBP places/NNS that/WDT we/PRP can/MD go/VB to/TO that/WDT feel/VB that/IN we/PRP are/VBP a/DT hundred/NN miles/NN away/RB from/IN the/DT skyscrapers/NN and/CC HDB/NNP blocks/NNP ,/, sit/VB down/VB under/IN the/DT stars/NN and/CC imagine/VB that/IN Singapore/NNP has/VBZ an/DT outback/NN ./. Hidden/JJ amongst/NN this/DT rural/JJ parts/NNS of/IN Singapore/NNP are/VBP some/JJ eateries/NNS like/IN Soulout/NN who/WP are/VBZ capitalizing/RB on/IN these/DT ``/JJ Ulu/NN ''/NN -LRB-/NN Rustic/NN -RRB-/NN prime/JJ estate/NN ./. Their/PRP appeal/NN is/VBZ to/TO provide/VB their/PRP$ customers/NN with/IN the/DT antithesis/NN of/IN what/WP the/DT rest/NN of/IN Singapore/NNP is/VBZ providing/RB ./. So/RB do/VBP n't/RB expect/VB interior/IN decor/NNP ala/NNP Ngee/NNP Ann/NNP school/NN of/IN interior/NNP design/NNP and/CC sensor/NNP operated/NNP toilet/NNP taps/NNP -LRB-/NNP actually/RB do/VBP n't/RB even/RB expect/VB the/DT tap/NN to/TO work/VB -RRB-/NN ./. We/PRP are/VBP talking/VBG bare/NNP concrete/NNP ,/, creaky/NNP ceiling/NNP fans/NNS and/CC stray/JJ dogs/NN feeding/NN on/IN your/PRP$ scraps/NN here/RB !/. I/PRP would/MD describe/VB Soulout/NN as/IN a/DT Cze/NNP Char/NNP Pub/NNP ./. Actually/RB ,/, when/WRB you/PRP think/VB about/IN it/PRP ,/, most/NN of/IN the/DT Kopitiam/NNP Cze/NNP Chars/NNP also/RB function/VB like/IN local/NNP Pubs/NNP where/WRB men/PRP go/VB have/VB something/NN to/TO eat/VB and/CC then/RB settle/JJ down/NN with/IN their/PRP$ bottles/NN of/IN Tiger/NN -LRB-/NN or/CC Calsberg/NN or/CC Heineken/NN depending/NN on/IN the/DT color/NN of/IN the/DT T/NN shirt/IN the/DT lady/JJ wears/NN -RRB-/NN while/NN watching/VBG football/NN ./. What/WP I/PRP am/VBP saying/VBG is/VBZ that/IN the/DT food/NN at/IN Soulout/NN is/VBZ more/JJ like/IN Pub/JJ food/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ food/NN with/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN flavor/NN ,/, but/CC simple/JJ ,/, straightforward/NN and/CC easy/NN to/TO prepare/VB ./. And/CC just/RB like/IN you/PRP would/MD expect/VB burgers/NNS and/CC fish/JJ n/NN chips/NNS in/IN an/DT English/JJ Pub/NN ,/, you/PRP can/MD expect/VB local/JJ favorites/NN that/WDT are/VBP full/JJ of/IN flavor/NN that/WDT would/MD make/VB you/PRP thirsty/VB for/IN another/DT pint/NN ./. Their/PRP$ Har/JJ Cheong/NN Gai/NN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ example/NN of/IN what/WP I/PRP mean/VB ./. Quintessentially/JJ Pub/NN food/NN ,/, fried/VBD Buffalo/NN wings/NNS are/VBP quick/JJ to/TO prepare/VB ,/, delicious/JJ and/CC make/VB you/PRP want/VB to/TO drink/VB more/JJ beer/NN ./. -LRB-/JJ or/CC Coke/RB in/IN my/PRP$ case/NN -RRB-/NN ./. But/CC their/PRP$ Har/JJ Cheong/NN Gai/NN is/VBZ quite/RB unique/JJ ./. It/PRP looks/VBZ a/DT bit/NN like/IN a/DT cross/NN between/IN Har/JJ Cheong/NN Gai/NN and/CC Buffalo/NN wings/NN ./. So/CC you/PRP got/VBD the/DT prawn/NN paste/NN flavor/NN as/IN well/RB as/IN the/DT heat/NN of/IN Buffalo/NN wings/NN ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ freshly/JJ fried/VBD ,/, piping/VBG hot/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ ./. Ca/RB n't/RB go/VB wrong/JJ to/TO have/VB a/DT plate/NN on/IN your/PRP$ table/NN ./. 4.25/DT \//JJ 5/CD Another/JJ good/JJ example/NN of/IN Pub/NN food/NN is/VBZ the/DT hotplate/JJ otah/NN ./. It/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB take/VB much/RB of/IN a/DT genius/NN to/TO place/NN a/DT piece/NN of/IN Muah/NN Otah/NN over/IN some/JJ eggs/NN on/IN a/DT hotplate/NN ,/, but/CC that/CC does/VBZ n't/RB make/VB it/PRP any/RB less/JJ delicious/JJ ./. But/CC hey/RB ,/, opening/VBG a/DT bag/NN of/IN chips/NNS and/CC putting/VB it/PRP on/IN a/DT plate/NN is/VBZ still/RB delicious/JJ too/RB right/JJ ?/. 4\/5/. It/PRP was/VBD our/JJ friend/NN Cactuskit/NN who/WP first/JJ introduced/IN us/PRP$ to/TO this/DT place/NN and/CC the/DT dish/NN that/IN captivated/NN him/PRP was/VBD their/PRP$ Mee/NNP Goreng/NNP ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT wet/NN ,/, Chinese/NNP style/NN Mee/NNP Goreng/NNP which/WDT was/VBD popularized/VBN by/IN Punggol/NNP Seafood/NNP many/JJ years/NNS ago/RB when/WRB they/PRP were/VBD still/RB in/IN the/DT old/JJ Punggol/NNP bus/NNP terminal/NNP at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT pier/NN ./. The/DT Mee/NNP Goreng/NNP here/RB is/VBZ very/RB well/RB fried/VBN and/CC delicious/JJ although/CC I/PRP felt/VBD most/NN of/IN the/DT flavor/NN comes/VBZ from/IN the/DT tomato/NN ketchup/NN and/CC Chilli/NN sauce/NN rather/RB than/IN a/DT robust/JJ seafood/NN stock/NN ./. 4.25/NNP \//NNP 5/LS Now/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP are/VBP really/RB heading/VB out/RP to/TO Soulout/VB for/IN drinks/NNS with/IN three/CD other/JJ friends/NNS ,/, then/RB their/PRP$ Pepper/NNP Crab/NNP and/CC beer/NN set/NN is/VBZ what/WP you/PRP might/VB want/VB to/TO order/VB ./. For/IN $/$ 45/CD ,/, you/PRP get/VB four/NN crabs/NN and/CC four/NN beers/NN and/CC you/PRP can/MD sit/VB out/VB in/IN the/DT farm/NN ,/, licking/IN the/DT black/JJ pepper/NN off/IN the/DT crab/NN shells/NN and/CC washing/VB it/PRP down/RB with/IN beer/NN ./. Not/RB bad/JJ for/IN a/DT night/NN out/IN with/IN friends/NNS ./. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB that/IN the/DT Black/JJ Pepper/NN sauce/NN is/VBZ anything/NN to/TO rave/VB about/IN but/CC the/DT crabs/NN come/VBN from/IN the/DT crab/NN distributor/NN who/WP occupies/VBZ the/DT same/JJ premises/NNS ,/, so/IN they/PRP are/VBP usually/RB quite/RB fresh/JJ ./. 3.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD Conclusion/NN This/DT is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO chill/VB out/RP with/IN some/JJ friends/NNS that/IN feels/NN as/IN if/IN you/PRP have/VBP just/RB gone/JJ through/IN the/DT 2/CD hour/NN wait/NN to/TO pass/VB immigration/NN ./. The/DT food/NN is/VBZ simple/JJ but/CC well/RB executed/JJ and/CC would/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ place/NN to/TO settle/VB to/TO have/VB dinner/NN after/IN bringing/VBG the/DT kids/NNS for/IN a/DT day/NN out/IN at/IN the/DT farm/NN !/.
