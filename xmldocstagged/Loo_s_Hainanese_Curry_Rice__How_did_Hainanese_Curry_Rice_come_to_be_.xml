<title>Loo's Hainanese Curry Rice: How did Hainanese Curry Rice come to be?</title>
<text>Hainanese/NNP curry/NN rice/NN is/VBZ defined/RB by/IN the/DT four/JJ classic/NN dishes/NNS of/IN Pork/NNP Chop/NNP ,/, Curry/NNP Chicken/NNP ,/, Chap/NNP Chye/NNP and/CC Kong/NNP Bak/NNP right/NN ?/. Ever/RB wondered/VBN why/WRB ?/. If/IN you/PRP go/VB to/TO Hainan/VB island/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO find/VB Hainanese/NNP Curry/NNP Rice/NNP because/IN this/DT is/VBZ a/DT style/NN of/IN cooking/NN that/WDT is/VBZ only/RB found/VBN in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. The/DT Hainanese/NNP were/VBD excellent/JJ cooks/NN and/CC were/VBD often/RB employed/VBN by/IN the/DT British/NN as/IN well/RB as/IN the/DT wealthy/JJ Peranakans/NN as/IN chefs/NN in/IN their/PRP$ homes/NN ./. They/PRP got/VBD the/DT Pork/NNP Chop/NNP idea/NN from/IN the/DT British/NN and/CC the/DT rest/NN from/IN the/DT Peranakans/NN ./. Curry/NNP Chicken/NNP ,/, Babi/NNP Ponteh/NNP and/CC Chap/NNP Chye/NNP ,/, these/DT were/VBD some/NN of/IN the/DT Nonya/JJ dishes/NNS which/WRB the/DT Hainanese/NNP cooks/NNP adapted/NNP for/IN Hainanese/NNP Curry/NNP Rice/NNP ./. Nowadays/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ instantly/JJ recognized/NNP Hainanese/NNP Curry/NNP Rice/NNP ./. Sure/JJ ,/, other/JJ economic/NN rice/NN stalls/NN might/VB sell/VB curry/NN ,/, kong/NN bak/NN and/CC chap/NN chye/NN ,/, but/CC they/PRP always/RB have/VBN a/DT slew/NN of/IN other/JJ dishes/NNS ./. If/IN you/PRP go/VB to/TO a/DT Hainanese/NNP Curry/NNP Rice/NNP stall/NN ,/, these/DT few/JJ dishes/NNS are/VBP the/DT main/JJ attraction/NN ./. You/PRP really/RB do/VBP n't/RB need/VB anything/NN else/RB ./. Over/VBN in/IN Tiong/NNP Bahru/NNP ,/, there/RB is/VBZ a/DT stall/NN selling/VBG just/RB such/JJ a/DT curry/NN rice/NN which/WRB dates/VBZ back/RB to/TO 1946/VB ./. But/CC just/RB because/IN it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT 64/JJ year/NN history/NN does/VBZ n't/RB mean/VB it/PRP is/VBZ necessarily/RB good/JJ ,/, although/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN it/PRP lasted/VBZ so/RB long/JJ does/VB mean/VB something/NN ./. No/JJ ,/, they/PRP are/VBP good/JJ because/IN the/DT uncle/NN here/RB still/RB insists/VB on/IN doing/VBG things/NNS the/DT traditional/JJ way/NN ./. So/CC the/DT Pork/NNP Chops/NNS are/VBP coated/VBN with/IN cream/NN crackers/NN instead/RB of/IN bread/NN crumbs/NN before/IN frying/VBG ./. This/DT is/VBZ how/RB my/JJ Hainanese/NNP mother/NNP in/IN law/NNP does/VBZ it/PRP and/CC if/IN you/PRP can/MD find/VB a/DT stall/NN that/IN still/RB does/VBZ it/PRP this/DT way/NN ,/, then/RB you/PRP know/VBP you/PRP have/VBP stumbled/VBN upon/IN a/DT Hainanese/NNP Hawker/NNP who/WP is/VBZ serious/JJ about/IN his/PRP$ food/NN ./. In/IN order/NN to/TO enjoy/VB the/DT Pork/NNP Chops/NNP ,/, you/PRP do/VB need/VB to/TO get/VB there/RB early/RB when/WRB the/DT Pork/NNP Chops/NNP have/VBN just/RB come/VB out/IN of/IN the/DT fryer/NN ./. Unfortunately/RB we/PRP got/VBD there/RB just/RB before/IN they/PRP closed/VBD so/IN the/DT Pork/NNP Chops/NN that/IN day/NN were/VBD not/RB that/IN crispy/NN ./. I/PRP notice/VBD though/IN that/WDT each/JJ pork/NN chop/NN is/VBZ made/VBD from/IN a/DT good/JJ slice/NN of/IN pork/NN loin/NN ie/IN it/PRP is/VBZ almost/RB like/IN your/PRP$ Japanese/NN Tonkatsu/NN ,/, and/CC not/RB a/DT piece/NN of/IN pork/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN pummeled/VBG to/TO death/VB ./. So/RB when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ hot/JJ out/IN of/IN the/DT fryer/NN ,/, it/PRP should/MD be/VB nice/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ ./. 4\/5/. The/DT killer/NN dish/NN for/IN me/PRP that/WDT day/NN was/VBD the/DT Curry/NNP Prawns/NNP ./. It/PRP was/VBD an/DT unexpected/JJ dish/NN since/IN we/PRP usually/RB order/VB the/DT Curry/NNP Chicken/NNP ./. The/DT gravy/NN was/VBD eye/NN openingly/NN good/JJ and/CC the/DT prawns/NNS were/VBD the/DT fresh/JJ sea/NN prawns/NNS which/WRB were/VBD big/JJ and/CC succulent/JJ ./. I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ that/IN their/PRP$ curry/NN takes/IN three/CD days/NNS to/TO prepare/VB ,/, from/IN the/DT preparation/NN of/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS ,/, to/TO the/DT grinding/NN ,/, to/TO the/DT frying/VBG of/IN the/DT rempah/NN and/CC finally/RB cooking/JJ the/DT curry/NN ./. The/DT rempah/NN forms/IN the/DT curry/NN base/NN for/IN all/DT their/PRP$ curry/NN dishes/NNS ./. The/DT prawn/NN curry/NN was/VBD fragrant/JJ and/CC has/VBZ a/DT natural/JJ sweetness/NN that/WDT got/VBD me/PRP lapping/VB it/PRP up/RB and/CC thinking/VBG of/IN when/WRB I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG back/RB again/RB ./. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD Unlike/IN the/DT Nonya/NN version/NN ,/, the/DT Hainanese/NNP Chap/NNP Chye/NNP sold/VBD at/IN these/DT hawker/NN stalls/NN is/VBZ very/RB simple/JJ ./. Of/IN course/NN ,/, when/WRB my/PRP$ mother-in-law/JJ cooks/NN Chap/NN Chye/NN ,/, there/RB is/VBZ a/DT lot/RB more/JJ stuff/NN in/IN the/DT dish/NN ./. But/CC at/IN these/DT Hainanese/NNP Curry/NNP Rice/NNP places/NNS ,/, Chap/NNP Chye/NNP means/NN cabbage/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN cooked/VBN till/NN they/PRP are/VBP slimy/NN and/CC soft/JJ and/CC when/WRB you/PRP order/VB just/RB one/CD plate/NN of/IN rice/NN with/IN the/DT dishes/NNS on/IN top/JJ ,/, they/PRP will/MD use/VB this/DT superbly/JJ slimy/NN concoction/NN as/IN a/DT topping/NN together/RB with/IN the/DT curry/NN and/CC braising/NN sauce/NN ./. The/DT Chap/NN Chye/NN here/RB is/VBZ ok/JJ but/CC nothing/NN exceptional/NN on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ./. However/RB ,/, it/PRP plays/VBZ a/DT large/JJ supporting/NN role/NN in/IN the/DT whole/JJ Hainanese/NNP Curry/NNP Rice/NNP experience/NN ./. 4\/5/JJ Although/CC Mr/NNP Loo/NNP told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT the/DT Kong/NNP Bak/NNP was/VBD an/DT adaptation/NN of/IN Babi/NN Ponteh/NN ,/, I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB help/VB but/CC think/VB that/WDT since/IN Kong/NNP Bak/NNP is/VBZ a/DT common/JJ dish/NN even/NN amongst/NN the/DT other/JJ dialect/NN groups/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ probably/RB something/NN quite/RB generic/NN ./. The/DT Kong/NNP Bak/NNP here/RB is/VBZ certainly/RB very/RB different/JJ from/IN the/DT Nonya/NN version/NN and/CC looks/VBZ and/CC taste/NN more/NN like/IN the/DT Teochew/NNP variety/NN ./. Again/RB ,/, eaten/VBD by/IN itself/PRP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO rave/VB about/IN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ like/IN listening/NN only/RB to/TO the/DT cello/NN in/IN a/DT three/CD string/NN orchestra/NN ./. But/CC it/PRP resonates/RB synergistically/VBD with/IN the/DT Curry/NNP and/CC Chap/JJ Chye/NN to/TO become/VBN a/DT melodious/JJ Hainanese/NNP symphony/NNP ./. Conclusion/NN I/PRP know/VB that/WDT three/CD of/IN the/DT four/JJ dishes/NNS only/RB scored/VBD 4\/5/JJ but/CC this/DT is/VBZ still/RB a/DT place/NN which/WDT I/PRP would/MD go/VB back/RB again/RB and/CC again/RB to/TO eat/VB the/DT curry/NN rice/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ just/RB the/DT combination/NN of/IN the/DT dishes/NNS and/CC the/DT whole/JJ environment/NN that/WDT makes/VBZ it/PRP a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO enjoy/VB Hainanese/NNP Curry/NNP Rice/NNP ./. That/DT said/JJ ,/, I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP would/MD have/VB had/VBN a/DT much/JJ better/NN meal/NN if/IN I/PRP had/VBD gone/RB there/RB before/IN 12pm/VBG when/WRB the/DT Pork/NNP Chops/NNS are/VBP still/RB coming/VB out/IN fresh/JJ from/IN the/DT fryer/NN !/.
