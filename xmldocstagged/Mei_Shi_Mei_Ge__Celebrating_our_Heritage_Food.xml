<title>Mei Shi Mei Ge: Celebrating our Heritage Food</title>
<text>It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT shame/NN that/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN kids/NNS who/WP are/VBP growing/JJ up/NN nowadays/RB can/MD not/RB speak/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ dialects/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ especially/RB true/JJ for/IN most/NN dialects/NN except/NN for/IN Cantonese/NN which/WDT is/VBZ preserved/VBD because/IN of/IN the/DT movies/JJ and/CC music/JJ coming/NN out/IN from/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP ./. Sadly/JJ ,/, my/PRP$ own/JJ kids/NNS ca/MD n't/RB even/RB say/VB ``/IN Teochew/NNP Nang/NNP Kah/NNP Chng/NNP Ang/NNP Ang/NNP ''/NNP -LRB-/NNP Teochew/NNP people/NNS have/VB red/JJ backsides/NN -RRB-/NN ./. Well/IN they/PRP can/MD but/CC they/PRP do/VBP it/PRP with/IN an/DT English/JJ intonation/NN ./. While/WP we/PRP have/VBP done/VBN a/DT great/JJ job/NN at/IN promoting/NN Mandarin/NN as/IN the/DT unifying/JJ language/NN amongst/NN the/DT Chinese/NNP people/NN ,/, I/PRP think/VB it/PRP came/VBD at/IN the/DT expense/NN of/IN losing/VBG the/DT rich/JJ Heritage/NN of/IN the/DT different/JJ Dialect/NN groups/NN ./. As/IN the/DT margins/NN between/IN the/DT different/JJ dialect/NN groups/NN slowly/RB become/VBN blurred/NN ,/, the/DT foods/NN associated/NN with/IN the/DT different/JJ dialect/NN groups/NN also/RB become/VBN less/JJ distinct/NN ./. Thus/WP we/PRP have/VBP Hokkiens/VBN selling/VBG Hainanese/NNP Chicken/NNP rice/NN for/IN instance/NN ./. Interestingly/JJ ,/, the/DT phenomenon/NN of/IN fusion/NN never/RB really/RB made/VBD its/PRP$ appearance/NN across/IN the/DT dishes/NNS ./. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP have/VBP ever/RB seen/VB a/DT Teochew/NNP man/NN selling/VBG Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP who/WP would/MD try/VB a/DT fusion/JJ Hokkien/NNP Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP Mee/NNP ./. The/DT closest/JJS I/PRP got/VBD was/VBD a/DT Teochew/NNP Man/NNP frying/VBG Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP who/WP addes/VBZ a/DT Seafood/JJ stock/NN to/TO his/PRP$ Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP just/RB like/IN a/DT Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP ./. But/CC the/DT dish/NN is/VBZ still/RB distinctively/VBD a/DT Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP ./. I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ that/IN the/DT good/JJ people/NN at/IN Kopitiam/NN also/RB feel/VB the/DT need/NN -LRB-/NN as/IN I/PRP do/VBP -RRB-/RB to/TO preserve/VB the/DT heritage/NN of/IN our/PRP$ dialect/JJ groups/NN when/WRB they/PRP set/NN up/IN their/PRP$ latest/JJS Food/NN Court/NN ./. The/DT new/JJ Mei/NNP Shi/NNP Mei/NNP Ke/NNP Food/NNP Court/NNP at/IN Hougang/NNP Mall/NNP endeavors/NN to/TO embrace/VB the/DT local/JJ dialects/NN and/CC highlight/VB the/DT origins/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ local/JJ favorites/NN ./. The/DT first/JJ thing/NN that/WDT impresses/VBZ you/PRP as/IN you/PRP approach/VBP the/DT Food/NN Court/NN is/VBZ the/DT decor/NN ./. They/PRP have/VB Chinese/NNP style/NN tables/NN and/CC chairs/NN and/CC calligraphy/NN decorating/IN the/DT walls/NNP featuring/NNP nursery/NNP rhymes/NNP from/IN the/DT five/CD common/NN dialect/NN groups/NN ./. The/DT uniforms/NN that/WDT adorn/VBZ the/DT hawkers/NNS also/RB hint/NN of/IN the/DT past/IN ./. Not/RB quite/RB Samsui/JJ Woman/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT association/NN is/VBZ not/RB difficult/JJ to/TO make/VB ./. Aside/RB from/IN the/DT outward/NN appearance/NN ,/, Kopitiam/RB has/VB also/RB made/VBD the/DT effort/NN to/TO resurrect/VB some/NN of/IN the/DT less/JJ common/NN hawker/NN fare/NN that/WDT are/VBP novel/JJ even/NN for/IN a/DT Gen/NNP X/NNP guy/NN like/IN myself/PRP ./. Take/VB for/IN instance/NN the/DT Hainanese/NNP Coconut/NNP Leaf/NNP Dumpling/NN which/WRB was/VBD a/DT first/JJ for/IN me/PRP ./. This/DT seems/VBZ like/IN a/DT cross/NN between/IN a/DT Bak/NNP Chang/NNP and/CC a/DT Ketupat/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ this/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB traditional/JJ Hainanese/NNP dish/NN ./. The/DT Glutinous/NN rice/NN is/VBZ dry/JJ and/CC has/VB bits/NNS of/IN dried/JJ shrimp/NN mixed/VBD into/IN the/DT rice/NN and/CC filled/VBD with/IN Kong/NNP Bak/NNP and/CC mushrooms/NNS ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB moist/JJ like/IN the/DT more/JJ familiar/JJ Lotus/NN Leaf/NN Dumpling/JJ but/CC dry/JJ and/CC savoury/JJ like/IN the/DT Pulut/NN Pangang/NN ./. Quite/RB an/DT interesting/JJ dish/NN to/TO try/VB ./. Both/JJ carnineviand/NN and/CC I/PRP were/VBD especially/RB delighted/VBD by/IN the/DT Hokkien/NNP Fried/NNP Pork/NNP Stuffing/NNP -LRB-/NNP Ngor/NN Hiang/NN -RRB-/NN which/WRB was/VBD being/VBG sold/VBD at/IN the/DT Mini/JJ Wok/NN stall/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD one/CD of/IN those/DT long/JJ lost/NN tastes/VBZ which/WDT suddenly/RB triggers/VB that/IN sense/NN of/IN nostalgia/NN that/WDT I/PRP had/VBD difficulty/VBN identifying/VBG at/IN first/JJ ./. Even/RB doing/VBG a/DT Google/JJ search/NN in/IN my/PRP$ long/JJ term/NN memory/NN failed/NN to/TO produce/VB any/RB results/JJ until/IN carnineviand/NN suddenly/RB said/JJ ``/NN Swimming/NN Pool/NN ''/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB it/PRP all/RB came/VBD back/RB to/TO me/PRP ./. It/PRP was/VBD that/IN Ngor/NN Hiang/NN that/IN I/PRP used/VBD to/TO eat/VB after/IN swimming/NN at/IN Toa/NNP Payoh/NNP Swimming/NNP Pool/NNP almost/RB thirty/CD years/NNS ago/RB !/. Carnineviand/DT 's/POS eyes/NN also/RB lit/VB up/NN and/CC we/PRP were/VBD both/DT celebrating/JJ the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP were/VBD at/IN the/DT same/JJ swimming/NN pool/NN at/IN around/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN !/. This/DT might/VBN sound/RB very/RB unusual/JJ ,/, but/CC that/CC cheap/JJ ,/, 30/CD cent/NNS ,/, Swimming/NNP Pool/NNP canteen/NNP Ngor/NN Hiang/NN was/VBD the/DT absolute/NN tastiest/JJS pseudo-meat/NN morsel/NN that/WDT can/MD really/RB satisfy/VB a/DT palate/NN that/WDT is/VBZ thoroughly/JJ cleansed/NN by/IN chlorine/NN ./. Since/CC then/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP never/RB really/RB found/VBD a/DT Ngor/NN Hiang/NN that/WDT had/VBD that/RB particular/JJ taste/NN ,/, that/WDT is/VBZ ,/, up/IN till/NN now/RB !/. ./. Perhaps/RB the/DT most/NN decorated/NN stall/NN that/IN they/PRP managed/VBD to/TO attract/VB is/VBZ Orchard/JJ Road/NNP Hup/NNP Kee/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ famous/JJ for/IN its/PRP$ iconic/JJ straw/NN hat/NN which/WDT serves/VBZ their/PRP$ Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP and/CC Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP on/IN Opeh/PRP leaves/VBZ ./. The/DT Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP was/VBD certainly/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT better/NN ones/NNS around/IN ./. However/RB I/PRP am/VBP of/IN the/DT opionion/NN that/IN Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP is/VBZ very/RB much/RB an/DT operator/JJ dependent/NN dish/NN unlike/NN Laksa/NNS where/WRB the/DT gravy/NN can/MD be/VB prepared/VBD beforehand/NN ,/, in/IN Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP there/RB is/VBZ the/DT element/NN of/IN frying/VBG that/WDT is/VBZ operator/JJ dependent/NN ./. Thus/JJ ,/, no/DT matter/NN how/RB good/JJ the/DT stock/NN is/VBZ ,/, it/PRP boils/VB down/VB to/TO the/DT control/NN of/IN the/DT wok/NN fire/NN and/CC the/DT timing/NN of/IN the/DT stir/NN fry/VB ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT single/JJ element/NN that/WDT separates/VBZ the/DT good/JJ from/IN the/DT great/JJ ./. Having/VBG said/JJ that/WDT ,/, both/DT Hokkien/NNP Mee/NNP and/CC Char/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP here/RB are/VBP very/RB good/JJ but/CC just/RB lacks/VBZ that/IN final/NN element/NN to/TO make/VB it/PRP great/RB ./. Those/RB looking/VBG for/IN something/NN a/DT little/JJ different/JJ to/TO tingle/VB the/DT tastebuds/NNS would/MD be/VB very/RB happy/JJ to/TO find/VB an/DT outlet/NN dishing/VBG out/IN Pu/NNP Tian/NNP Xing/NNP Hwa/NNP cuisine/NN ./. Pu/NNP Tian/NNP cuisine/NN is/VBZ gaining/VBG popularity/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP with/IN many/JJ new/JJ restaurants/NN opening/VBG around/IN the/DT island/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN we/PRP can/MD now/RB enjoy/VB the/DT food/NN without/IN having/VBG to/TO go/VB to/TO a/DT restaurant/NN ./. The/DT Pu/NNP Tian/NNP Fried/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN uses/VBZ a/DT very/RB thin/JJ Bee/NN Hoon/NN ,/, typical/NN of/IN the/DT dish/NN and/CC is/VBZ cooked/VBN in/IN a/DT very/RB mild/JJ stock/NN and/CC topped/VBD with/IN seaweed/NN and/CC peanuts/NNS ./. Quite/RB a/DT good/JJ dish/NN where/WRB you/PRP can/MD appreciate/VB the/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT Bee/NN Hoon/NN as/IN the/DT flavors/NNS are/VBP not/RB overpowering/JJ ./. I/PRP remember/VBP eating/VBG these/DT Fen/JJ Yuan/NN when/WRB I/PRP was/VBD a/DT kid/NN ./. Mom/JJ used/VBD to/TO make/VB them/PRP to/TO celebrate/VB Dong/NN Zhi/NN which/WRB marks/VBZ the/DT beginning/VBG of/IN Winter/NNP -LRB-/NNP in/IN China/NNP of/IN course/NN -RRB-/NN and/CC used/VBD to/TO tell/VB me/PRP that/WDT I/PRP would/MD be/VB one/CD year/NN older/NN when/WRB I/PRP eat/VB it/PRP ./. Nowadays/RB it/PRP is/VBZ more/RB common/JJ to/TO see/VB Tang/JJ Yuan/NN which/WDT is/VBZ filled/VBD with/IN peanuts/NNS ,/, red/JJ beans/NNS or/CC sesame/JJ paste/NN ./. So/CC I/PRP was/VBD very/RB intrigued/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN the/DT dessert/NN stall/NN here/RB is/VBZ making/VBG the/DT Fen/JJ Yuan/NN by/IN hand/NN ./. Aside/RB from/IN the/DT pink/JJ and/CC white/JJ ones/NNS they/PRP also/RB have/VB yam/JJ and/CC sweet/JJ potato/NN flavored/NN Fen/NN Yuan/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ certainly/RB a/DT blast/NN from/IN the/DT past/IN ./. This/DT is/VBZ certainly/RB a/DT food/NN court/NN with/IN some/JJ character/NN !/. Kopitiam/RB has/VBZ managed/VBN to/TO create/VB an/DT environment/NN where/WRB parents/PRP might/VB feel/VB the/DT urge/NN to/TO teach/VB their/PRP$ kids/NNS a/DT little/JJ about/IN the/DT past/IN ,/, ala/NNP ``/NNP Tan/NNP Ah/NN Teck/NN ''/NN :/: ``/NNP Long/NNP long/JJ time/NN ago/RB ,/, when/WRB your/PRP$ father/NN was/VBD still/RB your/JJ age/NN .../: we/PRP used/VBD to/TO eat/VB this/DT Fen/JJ Yuan/NN during/IN the/DT Dong/NNP Zhi/NNP festival/NNP .../: ./. ''/RB It/PRP would/MD be/VB great/JJ to/TO see/VB more/JJ food/NN courts/NNS like/IN these/DT and/CC to/TO have/VB the/DT concept/NN extended/NN to/TO include/VB our/PRP$ Malay/JJ and/CC Indian/JJ heritage/NN foods/NN !/. This/DT review/VB was/VBD commissioned/RB by/IN AsiaOne/NN Wine/NN &amp;/CC Dine/NNP This/NNP was/VBD first/JJ recommended/VBD by/IN wei/NN </text>
