<title>Tasty Buds: Tasty Homecooked Peranakan Food!</title>
<text>Joo/NNP Chiat/NNP continues/VBZ to/TO attract/VB boutique/NN eateries/NNS where/WRB women/NNP with/IN passion/NN for/IN cooking/NN can/MD share/VB their/PRP$ wonderful/JJ recipes/NN with/IN a/DT wider/JJ audience/NN ./. These/DT women/NN might/VBD have/VBN had/VBN a/DT first/JJ career/NN as/IN a/DT homemaker/NN or/CC CEO/NN ,/, but/CC once/RB the/DT kids/NNS have/VB all/DT grown/NN up/NN and/CC their/PRP$ financial/JJ burdens/NNS have/VBP lessen/VBN ,/, they/PRP choose/VB to/TO pursue/VB their/PRP$ dreams/NN rather/RB then/RB to/TO retire/VB to/TO a/DT life/NN of/IN eating/VBG dim/NNP sum/NNP and/CC doing/VBG facials/NN ./. For/IN these/DT women/NN ,/, the/DT menopause/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT time/NN to/TO Retire/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT time/NN to/TO !/. You/PRP can/MD probably/RB sense/NN that/IN I/PRP am/VBP speaking/JJ from/IN personal/JJ experience/NN ./. My/PRP$ mother/NN who/WP was/VBD a/DT housewife/NN -LRB-/IN the/DT politically/JJ correct/NN term/NN nowadays/RB is/VBZ homemaker/JJ -RRB-/NN for/IN most/NN of/IN her/PRP young/JJ adult/NN life/NN ,/, has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN passionate/JJ about/IN cooking/NN ./. So/RB when/WRB the/DT family/NN moved/VBD to/TO Australia/NNP ,/, she/PRP began/VBD her/PRP second/JJ career/NN as/IN a/DT chef/NN ./. She/PRP even/RB graduated/VBD top/NN of/IN her/PRP class/NN for/IN Australian/NNP Contemporary/NNP Cuisine/NNP when/WRB she/PRP was/VBD in/IN her/PRP fifties/NN ,/, beating/RB all/RB the/DT young/JJ aspiring/NN chefs/NN in/IN their/PRP$ twenties/NN and/CC received/VBD a/DT special/JJ award/NN from/IN a/DT Cabinet/JJ Minister/NN for/IN her/PRP achievement/NN ./. You/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG at/IN a/DT Teochew/NNP housewife/NNP with/IN no/DT prior/JJ knowledge/NN in/IN wines/NNS and/CC cheeses/JJ beating/NN all/IN the/DT young/JJ Ang/JJ Moh/NN Chefs/NN who/WP have/VBZ grown/VBN up/IN visiting/VBG vineyards/NN around/IN Australia/NNP ./. She/DT is/VBZ a/DT real/JJ wonder/VB and/CC this/DT blog/NN entry/NN is/VBZ dedicated/VBD to/TO her/PRP ./. She/RB has/VB just/RB started/VBD a/DT virtual/JJ test/NN kitchen/NN blog/NN of/IN her/PRP own/JJ which/WDT can/MD be/VB found/VBD here/RB ./. Gee/JJ ,/, I/PRP never/RB imagine/VB my/PRP$ mama/NN could/MD write/VB so/RB well/RB !/. Anyway/RB ,/, enough/RB of/IN my/PRP$ mama/NN ,/, back/RB to/TO someone/NN else/RB 's/POS mom/NN !/. Tasty/JJ Buds/NN is/VBZ a/DT restaurant/NN idea/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN brewing/VBG for/IN the/DT last/JJ 30/CD years/NNS ./. Irene/DT had/VBD dedicated/NN most/NN of/IN her/PRP life/NN to/TO helping/VB her/PRP husband/VB run/VB the/DT family/NN business/NN and/CC to/TO her/PRP family/NN ./. What/WP I/PRP am/VBP going/VBG to/TO say/VB next/RB is/VBZ as/RB predictable/JJ as/IN the/DT coconut/JJ tree/NN scene/NN in/IN a/DT Bollywood/JJ movie/NN --/NN Irene/NN started/VBD out/IN cooking/NN for/IN her/PRP friends/NNS during/IN special/JJ occasions/NNS ,/, but/CC they/PRP all/DT complained/NN that/IN they/PRP can/MD only/RB get/VB to/TO eat/VB her/PRP food/NN once/RB a/DT year/NN and/CC so/RB pestered/VB her/PRP to/TO open/VB a/DT restaurant/NN ./. So/RB after/IN many/JJ years/NNS of/IN pestering/NN her/PRP vision/NN finally/RB become/VBN a/DT reality/NN ./. The/DT choice/NN of/IN opening/VBG a/DT restauant/NN in/IN Joo/NNP Chiat/NNP is/VBZ a/DT natural/JJ one/CD ./. Her/NN great-grandfather/NN is/VBZ none/JJ other/JJ than/IN Mr/NNP Chew/NNP Joo/NNP Chiat/NNP ,/, who/WP used/VBD to/TO own/JJ the/DT whole/JJ area/NN of/IN Joo/NNP Chiat/NNP before/IN the/DT 1950/NN 's/POS ./. Joo/NNP Chiat/NNP in/IN those/DT days/NNS was/VBD a/DT coconut/NN plantation/NN and/CC Irene/NN used/VBD to/TO live/JJ in/IN the/DT one/CD and/CC only/JJ Bungalow/NN House/NN there/RB ./. Her/NN peranakan/NN recipes/NN were/VBD handed/RB down/VB from/IN her/PRP grandmother/RB who/WP used/VBD to/TO have/VB personal/JJ chefs/NN working/VBG in/IN their/PRP$ Mansion/NN ./. These/DT chefs/NN have/VBN subsequently/RB moved/VBD on/IN to/TO open/VB their/PRP$ own/JJ restaurants/NN around/IN the/DT area/NN ,/, most/NN notably/JJ Guan/NNP Hoe/NNP Restaurant/NN who/WP are/VBZ famous/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ Peranakan/NN food/NN ./. Although/CC Tasty/NNP Buds/NNP has/VBZ a/DT major/JJ emphasis/NN on/IN Peranakan/NN cuisine/NN ,/, Irene/NN and/CC her/PRP partner/VB Doreen/VB also/RB dish/JJ out/IN all/DT sorts/NN of/IN other/JJ Singaporean/NN favorites/NNS like/IN Dum/NN Briyani/NN ./. The/DT sight/NN of/IN the/DT beautifully/JJ colored/NN slender/NN grains/NNS of/IN Basmati/NN rice/NN is/VBZ as/IN pleasing/VBG as/IN the/DT actual/NN taste/NN and/CC texture/NN of/IN the/DT rice/NN itself/PRP ./. The/DT taste/NN of/IN the/DT Chicken/NN Masala/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ ,/, though/IN we/PRP would/MD have/VB liked/VBD it/PRP even/RB better/JJR if/IN the/DT chicken/NN pieces/NNS were/VBD smaller/NN and/CC cooked/VBN a/DT little/JJ longer/RB such/JJ that/IN the/DT meat/NN is/VBZ falling/JJ off/IN the/DT bone/NN ./. $/$ 5/CD per/NN single/NN portion/NN I/PRP have/VBP never/RB been/VBN big/JJ on/IN Mee/NNP Siam/NNP but/CC I/PRP can/MD truely/VB say/VB that/CC if/IN there/RB is/VBZ one/CD place/NN that/IN I/PRP would/MD return/VB just/RB for/IN the/DT Mee/NNP Siam/NNP ,/, this/DT would/MD be/VB it/PRP ./. The/DT sauce/NN is/VBZ nice/JJ and/CC savoury/JJ with/IN the/DT right/JJ balance/NN of/IN zest/NN and/CC heat/NN ./. I/PRP really/RB liked/VBD the/DT stewed/VBD fried/VBD shallots/NN that/IN Irene/NN uses/VBZ as/IN for/IN garnishing/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT only/RB memorable/JJ Mee/NNP Siam/NNP in/IN my/PRP$ books/NN ./. $/$ 3.50/CD Another/DT excellent/JJ dish/NN is/VBZ the/DT Ladies/JJ Fingers/NN with/IN Hae/NN Bee/NN Hiam/IN -LRB-/NNP Sambal/NNP dried/JJ prawns/NNS -RRB-/RB ./. Her/NN version/NN of/IN Hae/NN Bee/NN Hiam/NN is/VBZ really/RB special/JJ ./. It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB oily/JJ and/CC is/VBZ almost/RB like/IN eating/VBG spicy/JJ Pork/NNP Floss/NNP ./. She/JJ insists/NN on/IN using/VBG quality/JJ large/JJ Hae/NN Bee/NN which/WRB are/VBZ coarsely/RB chopped/VBN ,/, so/RB the/DT texture/NN is/VBZ very/RB distinctive/JJ ./. The/DT Ayam/NN Buah/NN Keluak/NN was/VBD done/VBN in/IN a/DT red/JJ colored/NN gravy/NN rather/RB than/IN the/DT usual/JJ dark/JJ brown/JJ ./. Like/IN the/DT Peramakan/NN version/NN ,/, the/DT nutty/NN kernels/NNS are/VBP first/JJ removed/NN ,/, mashed/NN and/CC put/VB back/RB into/IN the/DT shells/NN ./. We/PRP felt/VBD that/IN the/DT gravy/NN did/VBD not/RB have/VB enough/RB of/IN the/DT nutty/NN flavor/NN of/IN the/DT Buah/NN Keluak/NN and/CC needed/NN to/TO be/VB stewed/VBD a/DT lot/NN longer/RB ./. The/DT restaurant/NN is/VBZ opened/VBD throughout/IN the/DT day/NN and/CC is/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ place/NN to/TO drop/VB in/IN for/IN afternoon/NN tea/NN ./. They/PRP serve/VB a/DT whole/JJ variety/NN of/IN homemade/NN Nonya/NN desserts/NNS like/IN Kueh/NNP Lopis/NNP and/CC Bubur/NNP Kachang/NNP with/IN Durian/NNP -LRB-/NNP Green/NNP Bean/NN soup/NN -RRB-/NN ./. However/RB ,/, the/DT one/CD that/WDT would/MD make/VB you/PRP drive/VB all/DT the/DT way/NN from/IN Choa/NNP Chu/NNP Kang/NN to/TO eat/VB is/VBZ the/DT Durian/NNP Solo/NNP ./. This/DT is/VBZ creamy/JJ durian/NN paste/NN encased/NN in/IN a/DT crispy/JJ batter/NN ./. Oh/EX yes/EX !/. This/DT is/VBZ very/RB special/JJ indeed/RB !/. Opened/JJ only/RB since/IN January/VBG this/DT year/NN ,/, Tasty/NN Buds/NN is/VBZ the/DT kind/NN of/IN homely/NN ,/, personal/JJ restaurant/NN that/WDT you/PRP can/MD visit/VB to/TO eat/VB homestyle/RB Peranakan/JJ food/NN ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT restaurant/NN where/WRB you/PRP can/MD ring/VB up/IN first/JJ and/CC ask/VB if/IN Irene/PRP can/MD prepare/VB that/WDT special/JJ dish/NN for/IN you/PRP that/WDT Grandma/NNP -LRB-/NNP God/NNP Bless/. her/PRP Soul/VB -RRB-/VB used/VBD to/TO dish/NN out/IN when/WRB you/PRP were/VBD a/DT kid/NN ./. It/PRP might/VBD not/RB be/VB exactly/RB the/DT way/NN Grandma/NN used/VBD to/TO do/VB it/PRP ,/, but/CC at/IN least/RB Irene/NN is/VBZ willing/JJ to/TO give/VB it/PRP a/DT go/VB if/IN she/PRP is/VBZ familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT recipe/NN ./. With/IN her/PRP passion/NN for/IN the/DT food/NN and/CC her/PRP emphasis/VBD on/IN quality/NN ingredients/NNS ,/, I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/WDT she/PRP will/VB be/VB attracting/VBD a/DT loyal/NN following/NN of/IN foodies/NNS very/RB soon/RB ./. -LRB-/NNP T3/NNP +/NNP V2/NNP .25/NNP +/NNP S2/NNP +/NNP E1/NNP -RRB-/NNP </text>
