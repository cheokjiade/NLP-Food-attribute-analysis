<title>Relish: Burgers, Beer, Burgers, Beer, Burgers......</title>
<text>Burgers/NNS --/. They/PRP hold/VBZ a/DT special/JJ place/NN in/IN my/PRP$ heart/NN -LRB-/. And/CC I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mean/VB the/DT cholesterol/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN deposited/VBN in/IN the/DT arteries/JJ -RRB-/NN as/IN it/PRP does/VBZ in/IN many/JJ a/DT foodie/NN ./. The/DT very/RB thought/NN of/IN eating/VBG a/DT burger/NN just/RB conjures/NN up/IN childhood/JJ memories/NN of/IN eating/VBG this/DT delectable/JJ sandwich/NN in/IN clubs/NN ,/, Swenson/NNP 's/POS ,/, A&amp;W/NN and/CC MacDonald/NN 's/POS ./. Yes/EX ,/, back/RB in/IN the/DT days/NNS when/WRB you/PRP only/RB get/VB to/TO go/VB to/TO MacDonald/VB 's/POS when/WRB you/PRP scored/VBD well/RB on/IN your/PRP$ exams/NN --/IN the/DT Big/JJ Mac/NN was/VBD quite/RB a/DT treat/NN then/RB ./. Just/JJ why/WRB does/VBZ the/DT Hamburger/JJ have/VBN such/RB a/DT aura/NN of/IN desire/NN around/IN it/PRP ?/. It/PRP quite/RB simply/JJ is/VBZ the/DT King/NNP of/IN the/DT sandwiches/NN just/RB as/IN the/DT Durian/NNP is/VBZ the/DT King/NNP of/IN the/DT fruits/NN ./. Just/RB what/WP draws/NNP -LRB-/NNP predominantly/NNP -RRB-/NNP men/NN to/TO a/DT hamburger/NN ?/. How/WRB does/VBZ a/DT thick/JJ slab/NN of/IN minced/NN meat/NN cuddled/NN by/IN big/JJ soft/JJ round/NN buns/NNS resonate/IN so/RB well/RB with/IN the/DT male/NN machismo/NN ?/. Is/WBZ it/PRP because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ simple/JJ to/TO cook/VB ,/, that/WDT husbands/PRP would/MD occasionally/RB give/VB their/PRP$ wives/NNS a/DT break/NN ,/, fire/NN up/IN the/DT BBQ/NN and/CC pretend/NN to/TO be/VB Neanderthal/JJ Chefs/NN ?/. Or/CC is/VBZ it/PRP simply/VBZ because/IN a/DT good/JJ burger/NN is/VBZ just/RB darn/JJ good/JJ to/TO eat/VB ?/. Whatever/WP the/DT case/NN may/MD be/VB ,/, when/WRB I/PRP heard/VBN that/IN Wilin/NN from/IN Wild/NNP Rocket/NNP had/VBD opened/VBD a/DT Burger/NNP Restaurant/NN ,/, I/PRP just/RB had/VBD to/TO check/VB it/PRP out/RB ./. Now/RB the/DT idea/NN of/IN a/DT Gourmet/NNP Burger/NNP Restaurant/NN is/VBZ not/RB new/JJ ./. I/PRP think/VBP most/JJ people/NNS still/RB remember/VB the/DT ill/NNP fated/NNP Uberburger/NNP and/CC their/PRP$ $/$ 101/CD Wagyu/NNP Burger/NNP ./. Well/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP want/VB to/TO make/VB people/PRP pay/VB $/$ 101/CD for/IN a/DT Burger/NNP ,/, it/PRP better/NN be/VB darn/JJ good/JJ ./. So/RB opening/VBG another/DT Gourmet/JJ Burger/NNP joint/NNP so/RB soon/RB after/IN the/DT demise/NN of/IN Uberburger/NNP must/MD be/VB quite/RB a/DT calculated/JJ risk/NN ./. Whatever/WP the/DT case/NN may/MD be/VB ,/, I/PRP am/VBP just/RB glad/VB that/IN Singapore/NN still/RB has/VBZ a/DT restaurant/NN where/WRB the/DT people/NN simply/NN live/JJ and/CC breathe/JJ Burgers/NNS ./. Relish/PRP has/VBZ quite/RB a/DT list/NN of/IN gourmet/JJ burgers/NNS to/TO choose/VB from/IN so/IN I/PRP decided/VBD that/IN I/PRP would/MD just/RB try/VB a/DT selection/NN ./. The/DT curry/NN chicken/NN burger/NN was/VBD first/JJ out/IN of/IN the/DT kitchen/NN ./. The/DT pattie/NN was/VBD made/VBD from/IN chopped/VBN chicken/NN spiced/NN with/IN curry/NN leaves/VBZ ,/, chilli/NN and/CC other/JJ bits/NNS of/IN these/DT and/CC that/WDT and/CC it/PRP was/VBD accompanied/VBN by/IN sauteed/NN onions/NN and/CC a/DT curried/JJ mayonnaise/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD interesting/JJ ,/, but/CC pretty/RB mild/JJ if/IN you/PRP are/VBP gunning/JJ for/IN a/DT robust/JJ Cowboy/NN meal/NN ./. The/DT whole/JJ thing/NN had/VBD a/DT colonial/NN taste/NN to/TO it/PRP ./. You/PRP know/VBP ,/, like/IN the/DT curries/NNS the/DT Indian/NN Chefs/NN used/VBD to/TO cook/VB for/IN the/DT British/NNP Aristocracy/NNP --/NNP lots/NNS of/IN spice/NN but/CC without/IN the/DT heat/NN ./. Quite/JJ enjoyable/NN ,/, although/CC I/PRP felt/VBD the/DT pattie/NN could/MD have/VB been/VBN juicier/JJ and/CC punchier/JJ ./. It/PRP 's/POS an/DT alternative/NN for/IN people/NN who/WP do/VBP n't/RB take/VB beef/NN ./. Next/CC up/RB was/VBD the/DT well/RB reviewed/JJ Relish/NNP Burger/NNP ./. I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN wanting/VBG to/TO eat/VB this/DT burger/NN for/IN a/DT long/JJ time/NN ./. The/DT pattie/NN is/VBZ made/VBD from/IN Australian/NNP Chuck/NNP ,/, machine/NNP ground/NN and/CC hand/NN molded/NN ./. It/PRP 's/POS thick/NN and/CC done/VBN to/TO a/DT beautiful/JJ medium/NN rare/NN ./. The/DT texture/NN was/VBD great/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP lacked/VBD that/IN chargrilled/NN smoky/NN beefy/NN ooomph/NN I/PRP was/VBD yearning/JJ for/IN ./. What/WP does/VBZ stand/VB out/IN was/VBD the/DT sundried/NN tomato/NN relish/NN which/WDT added/VBD a/DT delicious/JJ zing/NN to/TO the/DT burger/NN ./. I/PRP remember/VBP having/VBG a/DT incredible/JJ Ramly/NNP Burger/NNP when/WRB the/DT Malaysian/JJ Tour/NN Bus/NN stopped/NN at/IN the/DT interchange/NN for/IN a/DT toilet/JJ break/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD 2am/VBN in/IN the/DT morning/NN ,/, chilly/NN and/CC there/RB were/VBD cow/NN pads/NN littered/NN all/RB across/IN the/DT bus-park/NN ./. That/DT first/JJ bite/VB of/IN the/DT piping/VBG hot/JJ Ramly/NNP Burger/NNP -LRB-/VBZ accompanied/VBN by/IN the/DT aroma/NN of/IN dried/JJ cow/NN pads/NN -RRB-/NN is/VBZ forever/JJ etched/NN in/IN my/PRP$ temporal/NN lobes/NN ./. It/PRP cost/NN only/RB RM/IN $/$ 1.50/CD at/IN the/DT time/NN ./. Therein/DT lies/VBZ the/DT problem/NN with/IN the/DT Ramly/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO serve/VB a/DT gourmet/JJ Ramly/NNP Burger/NNP and/CC charge/VB $/$ 19/CD for/IN it/PRP ,/, it/PRP ca/MD n't/RB just/RB be/VB bigger/JJR ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ got/VBN capture/NN and/CC go/VB beyond/NN that/IN elusive/NN Ramly/NN burger/NN taste/NN ./. The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT Ramly/NNP Burger/NNP 's/POS taste/NN comes/VBZ from/IN that/WDT piece/NN of/IN spiced/NN up/IN Cow/NN Spareparts/IN they/PRP call/VBP the/DT pattie/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ of/IN such/JJ dubious/NN quality/NN that/WDT our/PRP$ AVA/JJ wo/NN n't/RB even/RB let/VB us/PRP import/VB it/PRP into/IN Singapore/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ certainly/RB something/NN you/PRP want/VB to/TO eat/VB WELL/RB DONE/JJ and/CC truly/RB dead/JJ ./. The/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT Ramly/NN is/VBZ quite/RB reproducible/JJ ./. Once/IN the/DT pattie/NN is/VBZ done/VBN properly/RB -LRB-/IN it/PRP needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB pan/RB fried/VBD with/IN curry/NN powder/NN and/CC other/JJ condiments/NNS -RRB-/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ wrapped/RB in/IN a/DT thin/JJ egg/NN omelet/NN and/CC topped/VBD with/IN mayonnaise/NN and/CC -LRB-/NN cheap/JJ -RRB-/NN sweet/JJ chilli/NN sauce/NN ./. So/CC the/DT problem/NN with/IN the/DT Ram-Lee/NN is/VBZ the/DT way/NN the/DT beef/NN pattie/NN was/VBD prepared/VBD ./. It/PRP was/VBD simply/IN the/DT standard/JJ burger/NN pattie/NN used/VBD in/IN all/DT the/DT other/JJ burgers/NNS ./. It/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN much/JJ better/NN if/IN the/DT pattie/NN was/VBD spiced/JJ up/IN so/RB that/IN it/PRP had/VBD more/RB of/IN that/WDT ``/JJ Ramly/NN ''/NN taste/NN ./. It/PRP has/VBZ potential/JJ as/IN I/PRP feel/VB that/IN a/DT beefier/NN ,/, juicier/NN ,/, spicy/JJ beef/NN pattie/NN can/MD really/RB bring/VB the/DT Ramly/NN to/TO the/DT next/JJ level/NN ./. Considering/DT that/WDT I/PRP can/MD get/VB a/DT pretty/JJ shiok/NN Ramly/NN for/IN $/$ 3.50/CD ,/, I/PRP would/MD find/VB it/PRP hard/RB to/TO fork/VB out/IN another/DT $/$ 19/CD for/IN my/PRP$ next/JJ Ramly/NN fix/VB ./. The/DT one/CD that/WDT really/RB hit/VB the/DT U-Spot/NNP -LRB-/NNP Umami/NNP Spot/NNP -RRB-/NN that/IN afternoon/NN was/VBD ironically/RB ,/, the/DT Char/NNP Siew/NNP Burger/NNP which/WDT was/VBD not/RB really/RB a/DT burger/NN ,/, neither/NN was/VBD it/PRP really/RB Char/NNP Siew/NNP ./. -LRB-/JJ At/IN least/RB in/IN my/PRP$ books/NN -RRB-/. It/PRP was/VBD an/DT open/JJ sandwich/NN topped/VBD with/IN a/DT luscious/JJ melt/NN in/IN your/PRP$ mouth/NN piece/NN of/IN pork/NN soft/JJ bone/NN ./. Not/RB very/RB pretty/JJ to/TO look/VB at/IN but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ amazing/JJ things/NNS to/TO your/PRP$ taste/NN buds/NN ./. There/EX 's/POS a/DT lot/NN going/NN for/IN Relish/NN ./. The/DT place/NN has/VBZ a/DT nice/JJ laid/NN back/RB ,/, airy/RB feel/VB about/IN it/PRP and/CC the/DT simple/JJ menu/NN of/IN Burgers/NNS and/CC Beer/NN would/MD appeal/VB to/TO many/JJ people/NNS ./. For/IN a/DT Specialty/NNP Burger/NNP place/NN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/JJ that/IN they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB serve/VB a/DT Classic/NNP Burger/NNP with/IN the/DT Works/NN ./. -LRB-/DT Closest/NN they/PRP had/VBD was/VBD a/DT Bacon/NN and/CC Cheese/NN -RRB-/NN ,/, but/CC otherwise/CC it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN for/IN a/DT casual/JJ executive/NN lunch/NN and/CC a/DT place/NN to/TO unwind/VB in/IN the/DT evenings/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP into/IN designer/JJ beers/NN ./. </text>
