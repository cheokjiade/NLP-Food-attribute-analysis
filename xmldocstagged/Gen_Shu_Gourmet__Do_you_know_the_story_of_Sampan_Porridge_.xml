<title>Gen Shu Gourmet: Do you know the story of Sampan Porridge?</title>
<text>It/PRP is/VBZ said/JJ that/IN of/IN the/DT three/CD different/JJ types/NN of/IN porridge/NN that/WDT we/PRP commonly/VB get/VB in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, the/DT Cantonese/JJ Congee/NN is/VBZ the/DT most/JJ -LRB-/JJ natural/JJ -RRB-/NN gas/NN consuming/NN and/CC laborious/NN compared/VBD to/TO the/DT Teochew/NNP and/CC the/DT Hainanese/NNP version/NN ./. In/IN order/NN to/TO get/VB the/DT smooth/JJ consistency/NN of/IN a/DT Cantonese/JJ Congee/NN ,/, the/DT rice/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB on/IN a/DT furious/JJ boil/NN for/IN two/CD hours/NNS while/RB being/VBG constantly/RB stirred/JJ ./. Perhaps/RB that/WDT is/VBZ one/CD reason/NN why/WRB there/EX are/VBP not/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN Cantonese/JJ style/NN porridge/NN being/NN served/VBD in/IN our/PRP$ hawker/NN centres/NN ?/. I/PRP met/VBD up/IN again/RB with/IN our/PRP$ favorite/JJ Hong/NNP Kong/NNP Masterchef/NNP -LRB-/NNP retired/NNP -RRB-/NNP Gen/NNP Shu/NNP -LRB-/. That/DT 's/POS Uncle/NN Gen/NNP ,/, not/RB General/VB Shu/NNP -RRB-/NN for/IN breakfast/NN one/CD Sunday/NN morning/NN and/CC as/IN always/RB he/PRP has/VBZ many/JJ stories/NN to/TO tell/VB me/PRP ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB too/RB bad/JJ that/IN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB understand/VB Cantonese/JJ or/CC else/RB ,/, I/PRP assure/VBP you/PRP ,/, this/DT post/NN will/MD probably/RB be/VB 4/CD times/NNS longer/RB than/IN it/PRP is/VBZ ./. Anyway/RB ,/, having/VBG been/VB the/DT head/NN chef/NN in/IN a/DT major/JJ chain/NN of/IN Cantonese/JJ restaurants/NN ,/, Gen/NNP Shu/NNP is/VBZ big/JJ on/IN Congee/NN and/CC has/VBZ exacting/RB requirements/JJ for/IN what/WP he/PRP considers/VBZ a/DT good/JJ Cantonese/JJ style/NN porridge/NN ./. He/PRP tells/VBZ me/PRP that/IN the/DT texture/NN and/CC smoothness/NN of/IN the/DT porridge/NN is/VBZ paramount/RB ./. That/DT is/VBZ the/DT reason/NN why/WRB he/PRP combines/VBZ two/CD different/JJ types/NN of/IN rice/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT Congee/NN ./. The/DT smoothness/NN is/VBZ also/RB the/DT result/NN of/IN adding/NN fragrant/JJ oil/NN into/IN the/DT Congee/NN during/IN the/DT cooking/JJ process/NN so/IN that/WDT it/PRP becomes/RB emulsified/VBD into/IN the/DT porridge/NN ./. Once/IN the/DT Congee/NN is/VBZ made/VBD properly/RB ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB matter/VB what/WP ingredients/NNS you/PRP add/VB into/IN it/PRP ,/, it/PRP will/MD still/RB taste/VB good/JJ ./. We/PRP were/VBD there/RB one/CD morning/NN with/IN my/PRP$ kids/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ cousins/NN and/CC I/PRP can/MD tell/VB you/PRP that/WDT the/DT congee/NN is/VBZ so/RB good/JJ that/IN the/DT kids/NNS all/RB ordered/VBD extra/JJ bowls/NN of/IN the/DT PLAIN/NN Congee/NN just/RB to/TO eat/VB it/PRP !/. I/PRP think/VB that/WDT says/VBZ a/DT lot/NN about/IN the/DT Congee/NN !/. Gen/NNP Shu/NNP has/VBZ quite/RB a/DT few/JJ different/JJ toppings/NNS for/IN the/DT congee/NN but/CC the/DT most/JJ interesting/JJ one/CD is/VBZ the/DT one/CD with/IN pig/JJ skin/NN ,/, cuttlefish/NN ,/, sliced/VBN pork/NN ,/, peanuts/NNS and/CC fish/JJ cake/NN ./. Those/NNS of/IN you/PRP who/WP are/VBP familiar/JJ with/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP Cuisine/NN will/MD recognize/VB it/PRP immediately/NN as/IN Sampan/JJ Porridge/NN ./. Tradition/DT has/VBZ it/PRP that/IN the/DT Sampan/JJ Porridge/NN was/VBD served/VBN aboard/JJ sampans/NN that/WDT plied/. The/DT porridge/NN became/VBD so/RB popular/JJ that/IN restaurants/NN in/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP started/VBD serving/VBG it/PRP and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ now/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/NN famous/JJ Congees/NN in/IN Hong/NNP Kong/NNP ./. If/IN you/PRP visit/VB Gen/NNP Shu/NNP during/IN the/DT weekend/NN ,/, you/PRP also/RB have/VB the/DT chance/NN of/IN tasting/VBG his/PRP$ Lo/NNP Mai/NNP Kai/NNP ./. Gen/NNP Shu/NNP tells/VBZ me/PRP that/IN he/PRP finds/VBZ most/NN of/IN the/DT local/NN version/NN too/RB wet/JJ and/CC gummy/JJ ./. The/DT glutinous/JJ rice/NN in/IN Lo/NNP Mai/NNP Kai/NNP should/VBD not/RB be/VB gummy/JJ but/CC instead/RB hold/IN its/PRP$ shape/NN and/CC be/VB firm/JJ but/CC still/RB tender/JJ to/TO the/DT bite/VB ./. He/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB proud/JJ of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/WDT he/PRP is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ and/CC perhaps/JJ the/DT only/RB one/CD who/WP makes/VBZ a/DT rectangular/JJ shaped/NNP Lo/NNP Mai/NNP Kai/NNP ./. I/PRP was/VBD incredulous/JJ about/IN this/DT ./. Afterall/IN ,/, you/PRP just/RB need/VB to/TO change/NN the/DT shape/NN of/IN the/DT container/JJ right/NN ?/. Given/IN the/DT same/JJ ingredients/NNS ,/, I/PRP could/MD make/VB a/DT star/JJ shaped/NN one/CD if/IN I/PRP like/VB !/. Heck/. I/PRP could/MD even/RB make/VB one/CD the/DT shape/NN of/IN the/DT Gardens/NN by/IN the/DT Bay/NN !/. But/CC sorry/RB ,/, because/IN of/IN the/DT ``/NN Chicken/NN and/CC Duck/NN ''/NN kind/NN of/IN communication/NN between/IN me/PRP and/CC Gen/NNP Shu/NNP I/PRP never/RB quite/RB understood/IN his/PRP$ reasoning/NN behind/IN the/DT rectangular/NNP Lo/NNP Mai/NNP Gai/NNP !/. I/PRP do/VB get/VB that/IN the/DT glutinous/JJ rice/NN was/VBD a/DT nice/JJ texture/NN but/CC I/PRP think/VB I/PRP still/RB do/VB like/IN my/PRP$ Lo/NNP Mai/NNP Kai/NNP moist/NN and/CC gummy/NN because/IN that/WDT is/VBZ what/WP I/PRP grew/VBD up/RP eating/VBG !/. Conclusion/NN Great/JJ place/NN to/TO find/VB a/DT bowl/NN of/IN Cantonese/JJ style/NN Congee/NN and/CC especially/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN Sampan/NN Porridge/NN ./. The/DT kids/NNS simply/VBD love/RB the/DT plain/NN Congee/NN ./. My/PRP$ favorite/NN is/VBZ the/DT fried/JJ fish/NN porridge/NN but/CC really/RB ,/, your/PRP$ favorite/NN flavor/NN will/MD depend/VB on/IN your/PRP$ particular/JJ preference/NN for/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS ./. Postscript/DT Many/JJ thanks/NNS for/IN all/DT your/JJ prayers/NN ./. Gen/NNP Shu/NNP has/VBZ had/VBN a/DT successful/JJ heart/NN operation/NN and/CC is/VBZ now/RB back/RB at/IN the/DT stall/NN !/.
