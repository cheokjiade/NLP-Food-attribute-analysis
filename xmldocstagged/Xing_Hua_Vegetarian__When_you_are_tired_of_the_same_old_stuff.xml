<title>Xing Hua Vegetarian: When you are tired of the same old stuff</title>
<text>Here/RB I/PRP go/VB again/RB with/IN vegetarian/JJ food/NN ./. You/PRP know/VB I/PRP do/VB this/DT out/JJ of/IN a/DT guilty/JJ conscience/NN more/NN than/IN anything/NN else/RB ./. No/JJ ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB feel/VB guilty/JJ eating/NN meat/NN ,/, I/PRP feel/VB guilty/JJ subjecting/IN my/PRP$ body/NN to/TO too/RB much/JJ meat/NN ./. So/RB every/RB now/RB and/CC again/RB ,/, I/PRP venture/VBD to/TO eat/VB something/NN without/IN animal/NN proteins/NN in/IN it/PRP so/RB that/WDT I/PRP feel/VB good/JJ about/IN myself/PRP ,/, reset/IN the/DT computer/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP can/MD pig/VB out/VB again/RB !/. Anyway/NNP ,/, Chinese/NNP vegetarian/NNP food/NN can/MD get/VB quite/RB repetitive/VBD in/IN Singapore/NN and/CC most/NN vegetarian/NN stalls/NN serve/VB the/DT same/JJ variety/NN of/IN mock/JJ meats/NNS and/CC veg/JJ dishes/NNS ./. So/CC this/DT Heng/NNP Hwa/NNP vegetarian/NNP food/NN offers/VBZ something/NN a/DT little/JJ different/JJ ./. The/DT Heng/NNP Hwa/NNP Styled/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN is/VBZ actually/RB quite/RB tasty/JJ and/CC I/PRP would/MD n't/RB mind/VB eating/VBG it/PRP again/RB ./. This/DT dish/NN is/VBZ perhaps/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/NN iconic/JJ of/IN Heng/NNP Hwa/NNP dishes/NNS and/CC looks/VBZ almost/RB like/IN the/DT one/CD I/PRP had/VBD at/IN Pu/NN Tien/NN ./. The/DT bee/NN hoon/NN -LRB-/NN or/CC is/VBZ it/PRP Tang/RB Hoon/VBD ?/. -RRB-/CC here/RB is/VBZ however/RB a/DT bit/NN less/JJ fine/JJ than/IN the/DT one/CD over/IN at/IN Pu/NNP Tien/NNP ./. The/DT fried/VBD la/NN mien/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN is/VBZ best/JJ avoided/NN ./. Conclusion/NN Like/IN I/PRP said/JJ ,/, I/PRP eat/VBP vegetarian/JJ food/NN once/RB in/IN a/DT while/NN to/TO redeem/VB myself/PRP from/IN a/DT guilty/JJ conscience/NN ./. I/PRP would/MD n't/RB mind/VB coming/NN back/RB here/RB for/IN the/DT bee/NN hoon/NN next/JJ time/NN when/WRB I/PRP feel/VB that/IN way/NN again/RB ./.
