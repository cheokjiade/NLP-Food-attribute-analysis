<title>Quentins Eurasian Restaurant: Singapore's least understood cuisine!</title>
<text>You/PRP probably/RB know/VB a/DT few/JJ Eurasians/NN right/NN ?/. You/PRP know/VBP ,/, they/PRP are/VBP the/DT ones/NNS with/IN surnames/NN like/IN Pereira/NN ,/, Gomes/NN ,/, De/NNP Silva/NNP ,/, Olivero/NNP ,/, Xavier/NNP etc./NNP ./. You/PRP hear/VBP many/JJ of/IN them/PRP on/IN radio/NN ,/, especially/RB if/IN you/PRP tune/VBP into/IN 938live/NN ./. The/DT Eurasians/NN control/IN the/DT radio/NN waves/NN of/IN Singapore/NNP and/CC many/JJ of/IN them/PRP are/VBP also/RB on/IN TV/NN ./. Actually/RB ,/, the/DT very/RB first/JJ person/IN I/PRP met/VBD was/VBD a/DT Eurasian/NN ./. He/PRP was/VBD none/JJ other/JJ than/IN the/DT late/JJ Benjamin/NN Sheares/NN ,/, 2nd/CD President/NN of/IN Singapore/NNP ./. Of/IN course/NN when/WRB I/PRP first/RB met/VBD him/PRP ,/, he/PRP was/VBD my/PRP$ mother/NN 's/POS obstetrician/NN and/CC he/PRP was/VBD n't/RB the/DT President/NN then/RB ,/, but/CC it/PRP was/VBD my/PRP$ first/JJ brush/NN with/IN someone/NN important/JJ ./. When/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO Eurasian/VB food/NN ,/, I/PRP am/VBP a/DT total/NN ignoramus/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBP never/RB had/VBD Eruasian/NN food/NN before/RB ,/, or/CC even/RB if/IN I/PRP did/VBD ,/, I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB know/VB it/PRP was/VBD Eurasian/JJ food/NN ./. Perhaps/RB the/DT very/RB first/JJ Eurasian/NN dish/NN I/PRP came/VBD across/IN was/VBD Sugee/RB Cake/JJ ./. But/CC I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD Nonya/JJ since/IN it/PRP was/VBD sold/VBN at/IN Bengawan/NNP Solo/NNP ./. Did/DT you/PRP know/VB that/WDT there/EX are/VBP four/JJ official/NN races/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ?/. Chinese/NNP ,/, Malay/NN ,/, Indian/NN and/CC Eurasian/NN ./. So/CC they/PRP are/VBP officially/VBG a/DT minority/JJ race/NN !/. They/PRP were/VBD only/RB granted/VBD this/DT status/NN in/IN the/DT 90/CD 's/POS ./. Before/IN that/IN they/PRP were/VBD an/DT ``/JJ Others/NN ''/NN ./. For/IN such/JJ a/DT small/JJ community/NN ,/, the/DT Eurasians/NN have/VBZ produced/VBD many/JJ famous/JJ names/NNS like/IN the/DT aforementioned/NNP President/NNP Benjamin/NNP Sheares/NNP and/CC Minister/NNP E/NNP W/NNP Barker/NNP or/CC Eddie/NNP as/IN he/PRP is/VBZ affectionately/RB called/VBD ./. When/WRB you/PRP visit/VB Quentin/VB 's/POS ,/, you/PRP will/MD find/VB that/IN the/DT restaurant/NN itself/PRP is/VBZ called/VBD Eddie/NN 's/POS Place/NN ,/, in/IN honor/NN of/IN E/NN W/NN Barker/NN ./. The/DT Eurasians/NN came/VBD to/TO being/VBG when/WRB Malacca/PRP fell/VBD to/TO the/DT Portugese/NN in/IN 1511/NN ./. After/IN that/WDT ,/, the/DT Dutch/NN and/CC then/RB the/DT British/NN took/VBD over/RB in/IN succession/NN ./. The/DT intermarriage/NN of/IN the/DT Europeans/NN with/IN the/DT local/NN Asians/NN gave/VBD rise/NN to/TO the/DT Eurasians/JJ and/CC also/RB to/TO a/DT fusion/NN of/IN European/NN and/CC Asian/NN cuisines/NN ./. There/EX are/VBP not/RB many/JJ places/NNS left/JJ were/VBD you/PRP can/MD still/RB find/VB authentic/JJ Eurasian/NN cuisine/NN ./. Quentin/DT is/VBZ probably/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ fortresses/NNS where/WRB authentic/JJ home/NN cooked/VBN Eurasian/IN food/NN is/VBZ still/RB being/VBG defended/NN from/IN the/DT bombardment/NN of/IN development/NN ./. Eurasian/JJ food/NN is/VBZ something/NN that/WDT is/VBZ so/RB Singaporean/JJ and/CC yet/RB so/RB foreign/JJ ,/, so/RB old/JJ and/CC yet/RB so/RB new/JJ ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN a/DT novel/JJ culinary/JJ experience/NN ,/, then/RB you/PRP should/MD pop/VB down/VB to/TO the/DT Eurasian/NNP Community/NNP House/NN where/WRB Quentin/NNP Pereira/NNP still/RB prepares/JJ Eurasian/NN food/NN the/DT way/NN his/PRP$ father/NN used/VBD to/TO do/VB it/PRP ./. Patriach/JJ Robin/NN Pereira/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN those/DT passionate/JJ chefs/NN who/WP would/MD only/RB source/VB for/IN the/DT best/JJS ingredients/NNS to/TO feed/VB the/DT family/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ with/IN the/DT same/JJ spirit/NN that/IN Quentin/NN prepares/NN food/NN for/IN his/PRP$ restaurant/NN ./. Let/DT 's/POS start/VB with/IN the/DT only/JJ dish/NN which/WDT I/PRP knew/VBD was/VBD Eurasian/RB ./. Devil/DT 's/POS Curry/NNP ./. If/IN you/PRP think/VB Devil/VB 's/POS Curry/NNP is/VBZ called/VBD Devil/NNP 's/POS Curry/NNP because/IN the/DT stuff/NN is/VBZ made/VBD from/IN Chilli/NNP Padis/NNP from/IN the/DT Devil/NN 's/POS own/JJ backyard/NN ,/, then/RB you/PRP are/VBP 100/CD %/: wrong/JJ ./. I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ that/IN the/DT word/NN Devil/NN is/VBZ actually/RB derived/VBN from/IN ``/NNP Debal/NNP ''/NN which/WRB was/VBD a/DT dish/NN made/VBD from/IN leftovers/NNS after/IN Christmas/NN ./. So/RB besides/IN all/DT the/DT chilli/NN and/CC spices/NNS ,/, Curry/NNP Debal/NNP has/VBZ stuff/NN like/IN leftover/NN ham/NN and/CC turkey/NN in/IN it/PRP ./. We/PRP tried/VBD the/DT Oxtail/NNP Curry/NNP Debal/NNP which/WDT was/VBD quite/RB good/JJ ./. The/DT heat/NN has/VBZ been/VBN toned/VBN down/RB so/RB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ more/RB acceptable/JJ by/IN the/DT general/NN public/NN ,/, so/RB it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB near/JJ as/IN devilish/JJ as/IN I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB ./. What/WP was/VBD interesting/JJ was/VBD the/DT bits/NNS of/IN bacon/NN soft/JJ bones/NNS in/IN it/PRP which/WDT gave/VBD the/DT curry/NN its/PRP$ signature/JJ ,/, smoky/JJ aroma/NN ./. 4\/5/PRP Here/RB is/VBZ Robin/JJ Pereira/NN 's/POS recipe/NN for/IN Devil/NNP 's/POS Curry/NNP taken/VBN from/IN his/PRP$ book/NN ,/, Robin/NN 's/POS Eurasian/NN Recipes/NN which/WRB was/VBD just/RB released/JJ this/DT year/NN ./. --/JJ -RRB-/. The/DT meaty/JJ cutlets/NNS are/VBP also/RB something/NN I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB you/PRP try/VB especially/RB if/IN you/PRP like/VB corned/NN beef/NN ./. For/INs me/PRP ,/, corned/NN beef/NN reminds/NN me/PRP of/IN my/PRP$ childhood/NN as/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ father/NN was/VBD a/DT lover/NN of/IN the/DT canned/NN version/NN and/CC we/PRP used/VBD to/TO have/VB corned/NN beef/NN fried/VBD rice/NN and/CC corned/NN beef/NN omelette/NN ./. The/DT meaty/JJ cutlets/NNS are/VBP a/DT combination/NN of/IN corned/NN beef/NN and/CC pototoes/NN and/CC deep/VB fried/VBN in/IN a/DT biscuit/JJ crumbs/NN ./. You/PRP can/MD imagine/VB what/WP that/WDT tastes/VBZ like/IN ./. Yep/JJ ,/, it/PRP tastes/VBZ like/IN corned/NN beef/NN and/CC potatoes/NNS and/CC its/PRP$ comfort/JJ food/NN !/. Quentin/DT was/VBD sharing/RB a/DT very/RB interesting/JJ bit/NN of/IN info/NN on/IN the/DT Prawns/NN used/VBD for/IN Prawn/NNP Bostador/NNP ./. We/PRP all/DT remarked/NN how/RB crunchy/JJ the/DT prawns/NNS were/VBD and/CC he/PRP told/VBD us/PRP that/WDT is/VBZ all/DT boils/JJ down/NN to/TO how/WRB the/DT prawns/NNS were/VBD frozen/JJ and/CC thawed/JJ ./. He/PRP sources/NN prawns/NNS that/WDT are/VBP flash/JJ frozen/JJ and/CC then/RB thaws/VB them/PRP in/IN ice/NN water/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO get/VB that/IN crystal/NN crunchy/JJ texture/NN ./. He/PRP said/JJ that/WDT he/PRP had/VBD thawed/VB them/PRP out/VB before/IN at/IN room/NN temperature/NN and/CC the/DT texture/NN was/VBD different/JJ ./. This/DT is/VBZ something/NN I/PRP have/VBN to/TO try/VB the/DT next/JJ time/NN ./. The/DT best/JJS way/NN to/TO describe/VB Prawn/NNP Bostador/NNP is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT deconstructed/JJ Otak/NN Otak/NN ./. The/DT curry/NN tastes/VBZ very/RB much/JJ like/IN Otak/JJ Otak/NN which/WDT is/VBZ characterised/RB by/IN the/DT combination/NN of/IN Tumeric/NN leaves/VBZ with/IN Coconut/NN milk/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ dish/NN to/TO eat/VB with/IN rice/NN !/. The/DT brinjal/NN dish/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT surprise/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ sambal/NN brinjal/NN that/IN I/PRP have/VBP eaten/VBN in/IN recent/JJ memory/NN ./. The/DT brinjal/NN was/VBD subtly/RB sweet/JJ and/CC the/DT sweet/JJ and/CC sour/JJ sauce/NN complemented/VBD it/PRP perfectly/RB ./. Again/RB ,/, an/DT excellent/JJ dish/NN to/TO have/VB with/IN rice/NN ./. 4.5/DT \//JJ 5/CD If/CC there/RB is/VBZ a/DT cake/NN that/WDT best/JJS represents/IN the/DT Eurasian/NN community/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT Sugee/JJ cake/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ like/IN a/DT butter/NN pound/NN cake/NN ,/, except/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ made/VBD from/IN semolina/NN flour/NN and/CC ground/NN almonds/NN which/WDT give/VB its/PRP$ a/DT gritty/JJ crumbly/NN texture/NN ./. Quentin/DT tells/VBZ me/PRP that/WDT this/DT is/VBZ not/RB an/DT easy/JJ cake/NN to/TO get/VB right/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ as/RB temperamental/JJ as/IN a/DT Chiffon/JJ Cake/NN ./. To/WP me/PRP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT kind/NN of/IN ``/NNP Old/NNP Fashioned/NNP ''/NNP cake/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ heavy/JJ ,/, hearty/JJ and/CC delicious/JJ ,/, harkening/NN back/RB to/TO a/DT time/NN when/WRB eating/VBG butter/NN was/VBD the/DT most/NN natural/JJ thing/NN to/TO do/VB ./. This/DT cake/NN is/VBZ excellent/JJ at/IN tea/NN time/NN with/IN a/DT nice/JJ pot/NN of/IN English/NN Tea/NN !/. The/DT President/NN 's/POS home/NN is/VBZ just/RB opposite/JJ the/DT Eurasian/NNP Community/NNP House/NN and/CC Mrs/NNP Nathan/NNP is/VBZ especially/RB fond/JJ of/IN the/DT Sugee/NN cake/NN so/RB much/JJ so/IN that/WDT she/PRP has/VB personally/VB endorsed/VB it/PRP in/IN Robin/NNP 's/POS book/NN ./. Conclusion/NN Eurasian/NN cuisine/NN is/VBZ just/RB as/IN unique/JJ and/CC delicious/JJ as/IN any/DT other/JJ ./. Very/DT similar/JJ to/TO Nonya/VB cuisine/NN but/CC much/RB less/JJ understood/NN and/CC celebrated/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP have/VBP never/RB tried/VBN it/PRP before/RB ,/, perhaps/RB it/PRP is/VBZ time/NN to/TO pay/VB them/PRP a/DT visit/NN !/. In/IN his/PRP$ book/NN Quentin/NN recalls/IN the/DT time/NN when/WRB they/PRP just/RB started/VBD the/DT restaurant/NN at/IN Changi/NNP Business/NNP Park/NNP in/IN 2001/NNP ./. They/PRP would/MD go/VB to/TO the/DT market/NN and/CC buy/VB $/$ 100/CD of/IN ingredients/NNS but/CC the/DT sales/NN would/MD just/RB be/VB $/$ 70/CD ./. Such/DT is/VBZ Robin/RB 's/POS insistence/NN on/IN good/JJ quality/NN ingredients/NNS cooked/VBN fastiduously/NN ./. Here/RB at/IN Quentin/NN ,/, the/DT dishes/NNS are/VBP cooked/VBN only/RB when/WRB you/PRP order/VB them/PRP ,/, even/RB the/DT Devil/NN 's/POS Curry/NNP ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT philosophy/NN that/IN Robin/NN has/VBZ inculcated/VBN into/IN his/PRP$ kids/NNS and/CC I/PRP am/VBP glad/JJ that/IN they/PRP persist/VBD in/IN doing/VBG it/PRP ./. I/PRP was/VBD told/JJ that/WDT if/IN you/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO try/VB an/DT array/NN of/IN Eurasian/JJ dishes/NNS ,/, the/DT best/JJS is/VBZ to/TO go/VB and/CC enjoy/VB a/DT Sunday/JJ brunch/NNS where/WRB they/PRP serve/VB up/VB over/IN 30/CD different/JJ dishes/NNS for/IN $/$ 18/CD +/NN +/NN per/NN head/NN ./. 139/NNP Ceylon/NNP Road/NNP ,/, Eurasian/NNP Community/NNP House/NN ,/, Singapore/NNP 429744/NNP Tel/NNP :/: :/: 6348-0327/NNP \//NNP 6254-4556/NNP Mobile/NNP :/: 9147-0146/NNP http://www.quentins.com.sg//NNP If/IN you/PRP are/VBP interested/JJ to/TO learn/VB more/NN about/IN Eurasian/NN food/NN ,/, do/VB pick/VB up/IN a/DT copy/NN of/IN Robin/NN 's/POS book/NN ./. The/DT book/NN is/VBZ published/VBN by/IN Epigram/NN who/WP are/VBZ the/DT same/JJ publishers/NN that/WDT are/VBP publishing/VBG the/DT ieatishootipost/NN book/NN which/WDT will/VB be/VB released/JJ later/NN this/DT year/NN ./. There/EX are/VBP actually/RB two/CD other/JJ titles/NN in/IN this/DT series/NN on/IN Nonya/JJ and/CC Cantonese/JJ cuisines/NN which/WDT are/VBZ all/RB based/VBD on/IN Singapore/NNP Home/NNP Chef/NN 's/POS family/NN recipes/NN ./. -LRB-/. This/DT is/VBZ obviously/RB a/DT plug/NN for/IN my/PRP$ publishers/NN !/. -RRB-/RB </text>
