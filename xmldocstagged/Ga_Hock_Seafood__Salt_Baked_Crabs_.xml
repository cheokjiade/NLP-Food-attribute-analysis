<title>Ga Hock Seafood: Salt Baked Crabs!</title>
<text>If/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT crab/NN lover/NN ,/, you/PRP would/MD no/RB doubt/VB have/VBN heard/VBN about/IN Ga/NNP Hock/NNP 's/POS salt/NN baked/VBD crabs/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN wanting/VBG to/TO eat/VB at/IN Ga/NN Hock/NN for/IN the/DT longest/JJ time/NN ,/, but/CC never/RB managed/VBD to/TO get/VB down/NN to/TO it/PRP till/NN now/RB ./. I/PRP had/VBD always/RB imagined/IN the/DT salt/NN baked/VBD crab/NN is/VBZ like/IN salt/NN baked/VBD chicken/NN where/WRB the/DT whole/JJ crab/NN is/VBZ encrusted/RB in/IN salt/NN and/CC then/RB baked/VBD in/IN the/DT oven/NN ./. So/RB when/WRB the/DT crabs/NN were/VBD finally/RB presented/VBD to/TO me/PRP ,/, it/PRP was/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN an/DT anticlimax/NN ./. It/PRP looked/VBD like/IN the/DT crab/NN was/VBD just/RB dusted/JJ with/IN pepper/NN and/CC salt/NN and/CC baked/VBD in/IN the/DT oven/NN !/. So/RB simple/JJ ah/NN ?/. Looks/VBZ like/IN something/NN that/WDT I/PRP can/MD do/VB at/IN home/NN !/. When/WRB crabs/NN are/VBP cooked/VBN so/RB simply/JJ ,/, a/DT lot/NN will/MD have/VB to/TO depend/VB on/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT crabs/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT crab/NN lover/NN ,/, you/PRP would/MD no/RB doubt/VB have/VBN felt/VBD the/DT pinch/NN of/IN the/DT increasing/VBD prices/NN of/IN crabs/NN in/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ./. So/RB when/WRB you/PRP have/VB to/TO pay/VB $/$ 65/CD for/IN a/DT 1.5/CD kg/NN crab/NN ,/, you/PRP would/MD expect/VB it/PRP to/TO be/VB solid/NN ./. As/CC it/PRP turned/VBD out/IN ,/, I/PRP was/VBD actually/RB quite/RB disappointed/JJ with/IN the/DT salt/NN baked/VBD crab/NN ./. We/PRP ordered/VBD one/CD male/NN and/CC one/CD female/NN crab/NN ./. The/DT male/NN had/VBD nice/JJ large/JJ claws/NN which/WDT were/VBD only/RB half/RB filled/VBD ./. The/DT meat/NN was/VBD on/IN the/DT female/JJ crab/NN was/VBD solid/RB enough/JJ but/CC I/PRP could/MD n't/RB help/VB but/CC go/VB away/RB feeling/VBG that/WDT we/PRP could/MD have/VB spent/RB much/RB less/JJ buying/IN our/PRP$ own/JJ crabs/NN and/CC baking/VB it/PRP ourselves/RB ./. Afterall/IN ,/, when/WRB you/PRP pay/VB so/RB much/JJ for/IN crabs/NN ,/, you/PRP would/MD expect/VB that/IN the/DT crabs/NN meet/NN up/NN to/TO a/DT certain/JJ standard/JJ ./. To/RB be/VB fair/JJ ,/, after/IN the/DT meal/NN ,/, I/PRP enquired/VBD about/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT crabs/NN and/CC was/VBD told/JJ that/WDT if/IN we/PRP had/VBD told/VBN them/PRP about/IN it/PRP before/IN we/PRP started/VBD eating/VBG ,/, they/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN happy/JJ to/TO exchange/VB the/DT crabs/NN for/IN us/PRP ./. That/DT being/NN said/JJ ,/, I/PRP still/RB felt/VBD that/IN if/IN they/PRP have/VBP a/DT one/CD to/TO one/CD exchange/NN policy/NN with/IN the/DT supplier/NN then/RB it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN much/JJ better/NN if/IN they/PRP would/MD automatically/RB switch/VB to/TO a/DT meatier/JJ crab/NN when/WRB they/PRP crack/VB open/VB the/DT shell/NN and/CC see/VB the/DT lack/NN of/IN meat/NN in/IN the/DT claws/NN ./. Tastewise/NN ,/, you/PRP really/RB do/VBP n't/RB need/VB to/TO stretch/NN your/PRP$ imagination/NN too/RB much/JJ to/TO know/VB how/WRB salt/NN and/CC pepper/NN would/MD taste/VB with/IN crab/NN ./. The/DT dish/NN that/IN I/PRP really/RB fell/VBD in/IN love/VB with/IN that/DT day/NN were/VBD the/DT butter/NN sotong/NN ./. They/PRP reminded/VB me/PRP of/IN the/DT sotong/. I/PRP always/RB eat/VB when/WRB I/PRP am/VBP fishing/VBN in/IN Rompin/NN ./. I/PRP would/MD go/VB so/RB far/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ my/PRP$ favorite/NN way/NN of/IN cooking/NN sotong/NN ./. Tender/DT on/IN the/DT inside/NN with/IN a/DT crunchy/JJ crust/NN which/WDT has/VBZ enough/RB sauce/NN to/IN flavor/NN it/PRP but/CC maintaining/IN its/PRP$ crispiness/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ really/RB a/DT no/RB brainer/NN ./. Fish/NNP Head/NNP Curry/NNP is/VBZ the/DT other/JJ signature/JJ dish/NN of/IN Ga/NN Hock/NN ./. The/DT gravy/NN was/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./. It/PRP is/VBZ nonya/JJ style/NN fish/NN head/NN curry/NN ,/, so/RB the/DT gravy/NN was/VBD rich/JJ and/CC coconutty/JJ ./. The/DT half/NN head/NN we/PRP were/VBD given/VBN was/VBD unfortunately/VBN not/RB too/RB fresh/JJ that/IN day/NN and/CC I/PRP felt/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT tad/NN small/JJ for/IN the/DT claypot/NN ./. Perhaps/RB it/PRP is/VBZ another/DT sign/NN of/IN the/DT diminishing/NN supply/NN of/IN seafood/NN ?/. We/PRP had/VBD two/CD dishes/NNS that/IN evening/NN which/WDT made/VBD use/VB of/IN their/PRP$ sambal/NN chilli/NN sauce/NN and/CC they/PRP were/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./. There/EX is/VBZ no/RB lack/JJ of/IN hae/JJ bee/NN -LRB-/NN dried/JJ shrimps/NN -RRB-/NN in/IN the/DT sambal/NN ,/, so/RB both/DT the/DT sambal/NN la/NN la/NN and/CC the/DT sambal/NN kangkong/NN were/VBD spicy/JJ ,/, savoury/NN and/CC shiok/NN !/. Conclusion/NN My/PRP$ personal/JJ experience/NN at/IN Ga/NNP Hock/NNP did/VBD not/RB really/RB live/JJ up/NN to/TO expectations/NN ,/, but/CC my/PRP$ friend/NN SCS/NN Butter/NN who/WP eats/VBZ there/RB every/DT month/NN tells/VBZ me/PRP that/CC it/PRP was/VBD just/RB a/DT one/CD off/IN ./. Apart/JJ from/IN the/DT food/NN ,/, Ga/NNP Hock/NNP does/VBZ have/VBN that/IN rustic/NN environment/NN going/NN for/IN it/PRP ./. When/WRB you/PRP are/VBP eating/VBG there/RB ,/, you/PRP can/MD just/RB imagine/VB that/IN you/PRP are/VBP somewhere/VBN in/IN Malaysia/NNP ./. I/PRP think/VB it/PRP does/VBZ deserve/RB a/DT return/JJ visit/NN for/IN me/PRP if/IN not/RB just/RB for/IN the/DT butter/NN sotong/NN ./. But/CC next/JJ time/NN I/PRP will/VB be/VB wiser/VBD to/TO complain/VB about/IN empty/NN crab/NN claws/NN and/CC get/VB them/PRP to/TO replace/VB it/PRP before/RB tucking/VBD in/IN !/.
