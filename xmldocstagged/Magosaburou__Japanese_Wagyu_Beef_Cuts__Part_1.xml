<title>Magosaburou: Japanese Wagyu Beef Cuts: Part 1</title>
<text>The/DT inspiration/NN for/IN the/DT next/JJ series/NN of/IN posts/NNS came/VBD from/IN watching/VBG this/DT episode/NN of/IN the/DT Korean/NNP food/NNP drama/NNP ,/, Gourmet/NNP -LRB-/NNP Sik/NNP Gaek/NNP 식객/NNP -RRB-/NNP where/WRB the/DT protagonist/NN ,/, Sung/NNP Chan/NNP took/VBD part/NN in/IN a/DT beef/NN tasting/VBG contest/NN in/IN which/WRB he/PRP had/VBD to/TO identify/VB different/JJ cuts/NNS of/IN beef/NN blindfolded/NN !/. This/DT got/VBD me/PRP really/RB intrigued/JJ ,/, and/CC I/PRP told/VBD myself/PRP that/WDT one/CD day/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD want/VB to/TO do/VB a/DT beef/NN deGYUstation/NN myself/PRP ./. One/CD of/IN the/DT best/JJ ways/NN to/TO experience/NN such/IN a/DT deGYUstation/NN is/VBZ to/TO dine/VB Yakiniku/NNP style/NN ./. When/WRB I/PRP was/VBD in/IN Tokyo/NN recently/RB ,/, my/PRP$ friend/NN Hisato/VBZ brought/VBN me/PRP to/TO a/DT Yakiniku/NNP restaurant/NN and/CC we/PRP literally/RB ate/VBD every/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT cow/NN including/IN the/DT Naizou/NN -LRB-/NN innards/VBZ -RRB-/RB ./. In/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, not/RB only/RB is/VBZ there/RB a/DT restriction/NN on/IN the/DT importation/NN of/IN innards/VBZ ,/, most/NN Yakiniku/NNP restaurants/NNS only/RB bring/VBN in/IN selected/CD parts/NNS of/IN the/DT cow/NN ./. So/CC most/RB of/IN us/PRP would/MD be/VB more/RB familiar/JJ with/IN the/DT popular/JJ cuts/NNS like/IN Ribeye/NN ,/, Sirloin/NN and/CC Short/NN Rib/NN ./. The/DT opportunity/NN for/IN my/PRP$ deGYUstation/NN arose/NN when/WRB my/PRP$ friend/NN Shinji/NN informed/VBD me/PRP that/WDT Magosaburou/NNP actually/RB imports/IN the/DT whole/JJ cow/NN for/IN their/PRP$ restaurant/NN ./. According/VBG to/TO the/DT people/NN at/IN Magosaburou/NNP ,/, their/PRP$ Wagyu/NN experts/NN went/VBD all/RB around/IN Japan/NNP looking/VBG for/IN the/DT best/JJS Wagyu/NN and/CC finally/RB chose/JJ Kurohana/NNP Wagyu/NNP from/IN Kumamoto/NNP prefecture/NNP -LRB-/NNP Kyushu/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. In/IN order/NN to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO serve/VB this/DT beef/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, they/PRP had/VBD to/TO import/VB the/DT whole/JJ cow/NN in/IN themselves/NN instead/RB of/IN just/RB selected/JJ cuts/NNS ./. This/DT means/NN that/WDT not/RB only/RB are/VBP they/PRP the/DT only/JJ ones/NNS in/IN Singapore/NNP that/WDT serve/VB Kurohana/NNP Wagyu/NNP ,/, they/PRP also/RB serve/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT rarer/NN cuts/NNS of/IN meat/NN which/WRB you/PRP can/MD only/RB get/VB when/WRB you/PRP import/VB the/DT whole/JJ cow/NN !/. Let/DT 's/POS start/VB our/PRP$ deGYUstation/NN with/IN the/DT more/JJ familiar/JJ cuts/NNS before/IN we/PRP get/VB to/TO the/DT more/JJ esoteric/NN ones/NNS ./. The/DT Ribeye/NN is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO start/VB as/IN it/PRP also/RB happens/VBZ to/TO be/VB my/PRP$ favorite/NN cut/NN for/IN steaks/NNS ./. I/PRP have/VBN to/TO emphasize/VB ``/NN for/IN steaks/NNS ''/RB because/IN all/DT parts/NNS of/IN the/DT beef/NN cattle/NNS are/VBP delicious/JJ if/IN they/PRP are/VBP cooked/VBN in/IN the/DT right/JJ way/NN ./. So/RB if/IN I/PRP am/VBP thinking/VBG of/IN Cantonese/JJ style/NN stewed/VBD beef/NN ,/, then/RB the/DT brisket/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN my/PRP$ favorite/NN cut/NN ./. But/CC when/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ to/TO a/DT beef/NN steak/NN ,/, Ribeye/NN is/VBZ king/RB ./. In/IN fact/NN ,/, if/IN I/PRP had/VBD my/PRP$ way/NN ,/, I/PRP would/MD be/VB only/RB eating/VBG the/DT Ribeye/JJ cap/NN ,/, which/WDT the/DT Japanese/NN call/VBP ``/JJ Kaburi/NN ''/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT thin/JJ flap/NN of/IN meat/NN around/IN the/DT rim/NN of/IN the/DT Ribeye/JJ steak/NN which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT most/NN most/NN tender/JJ and/CC flavourful/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ cow/NN ./. The/DT Ribeye/NN is/VBZ essentially/RB made/VBD up/NN of/IN three/CD muscles/NNS ./. The/DT large/JJ central/NN one/CD is/VBZ the/DT longissimus/JJ dorsi/NN muscle/NN with/IN is/VBZ a/DT long/JJ muscle/NN that/IN stretches/NN down/IN the/DT back/RB of/IN the/DT cow/NN ./. There/EX are/VBP two/CD muscles/NNS that/IN constitute/JJ the/DT cap/NN ,/, viz/NNP the/DT spinalis/NN dorsi/NN and/CC multifidus/NN dorsi/NN ./. These/DT are/VBP two/CD flat/NN muscles/NN that/IN lie/NN next/JJ to/TO the/DT backbone/NN of/IN the/DT cattle/NNS and/CC are/VBP very/RB tender/JJ ,/, extremely/JJ marbled/NN and/CC very/RB flavourful/JJ ./. Some/DT chefs/NN call/VBP this/DT the/DT ``/NN butter/NN ''/NN of/IN the/DT cow/NN ./. I/PRP call/VBP it/PRP beef/NN heaven/NN ./. Because/. these/DT cuts/NNS are/VBP generally/RB quite/RB tender/JJ to/TO begin/VB with/IN ,/, most/NN Yakiniku/NNP restaurants/NN would/MD cut/VB them/PRP relatively/VB thick/NN ,/, just/RB shy/VB of/IN a/DT centimetre/NN ./. When/WRB you/PRP sink/VB your/PRP$ teeth/NN into/IN a/DT slice/NN of/IN nicely/RB grilled/VBN Ribeye/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD be/VB rewarded/VBD with/IN a/DT burst/NN of/IN beefy/NN juices/NNS ./. Now/RB close/VB your/PRP$ eyes/NN and/CC allow/VBD the/DT aroma/NN waft/NN up/IN your/PRP$ nose/NN ,/, let/VB the/DT umami/NN flavor/NN linger/NN at/IN the/DT back/RB of/IN your/PRP$ palate/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN and/CC wash/VB it/PRP all/RB down/VB with/IN a/DT sip/NN of/IN sake/NN !/. Ah/UH .../: As/CC you/PRP move/VB down/VB the/DT back/RB of/IN the/DT cow/NN to/TO where/WRB the/DT rib/NN cage/NN ends/VBZ -LRB-/JJ 13th/NN rib/NN -RRB-/NN ,/, you/PRP get/VB to/TO the/DT Sirloin/JJ -LRB-/NN Shortloin/NN in/IN the/DT US/NNP -RRB-/NNP primal/NNP ./. This/DT cut/NN is/VBZ characterized/VBD by/IN a/DT thick/JJ layer/NN of/IN fat/NN on/IN one/CD side/NN of/IN the/DT steak/NN ./. Being/VBG a/DT non-weight/JJ bearing/NN muscle/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT very/RB tender/JJ cut/NN and/CC very/RB popular/JJ for/IN steaks/NNS ./. The/DT texture/NN ,/, juiciness/NN and/CC flavor/NN of/IN the/DT Sirloin/NN is/VBZ very/RB similar/JJ to/TO the/DT center/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT Ribeye/NN because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ basically/IN the/DT continuation/NN of/IN the/DT same/JJ longissimus/NN dorsi/NN muscle/NN down/IN the/DT back/RB of/IN the/DT cow/NN ./. Contrary/JJ to/TO what/WP is/VBZ popularly/JJ believed/NN ./. The/DT Sirloin/NN is/VBZ not/RB called/VBD ``/NNP Sir/NNP ''/NNP loin/NN to/TO denote/VB its/PRP$ premium/NN status/JJ amongst/NN steaks/NNS ./. Rather/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD derived/VBN from/IN the/DT old/JJ French/NN ``/NN surlonge/NN ''/NN which/WRB means/VBZ ``/NN above/IN the/DT loins/NN ''/NN ./. In/IN Singapore/NNP ,/, a/DT Sirloin/NN steak/NN usually/RB refers/VBZ to/TO the/DT Shortloin/JJ portion/NN of/IN the/DT cattle/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT portion/NN of/IN the/DT cattle/NNS between/IN the/DT ribcage/NN and/CC the/DT pelvic/JJ bone/NN ./. This/DT primal/NN is/VBZ a/DT little/JJ more/JJ confusing/NN because/IN the/DT British/NN and/CC Americans/NN define/IN their/PRP$ Sirloin/NN primal/NN differently/NN ./. The/DT Sirloin/NNP primal/NNP -LRB-/NNP US/NNP -RRB-/NNP covers/IN the/DT entire/JJ hip/NN area/NN of/IN the/DT cattle/NNS and/CC is/VBZ divided/JJ into/IN Top/JJ Sirloin/NN ,/, Bottom/NN Sirloin/NN ,/, Sirloin/NN Tip/NN and/CC Sirloin/NN Cap/NN ./. The/DT premium/NN cut/NN is/VBZ the/DT Striploin/NN which/WDT is/VBZ commonly/RB called/VBD the/DT Sirloin/NN in/IN Singapore/NNP and/CC it/PRP should/MD look/VB like/IN the/DT photo/NN above/NN ./. Some/DT restaurants/NN might/VB serve/VB Sirloin/RB Tip/JJ or/CC Top/JJ Sirloin/NN and/CC price/NN it/PRP very/RB competitively/JJ ./. These/DT are/VBP fine/JJ and/CC are/VBP perfectly/RB good/JJ meats/NNS but/CC they/PRP should/VB be/VB not/RB be/VB confused/VBD with/IN a/DT proper/JJ Sirloin/NN steak/NN ./. The/DT tenderloin/NN is/VBZ a/DT favorite/JJ amongst/NN the/DT ladies/NNS as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT most/JJ tender/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT cow/NN and/CC usually/RB contains/RB very/RB little/JJ fat/NN ./. However/RB ,/, the/DT marbling/VBG can/MD still/RB be/VB quite/RB intense/VBD in/IN the/DT Wagyu/NN cattle/NNS as/IN you/PRP can/MD see/VB from/IN the/DT photo/NN above/NN ./. Technically/JJ ,/, this/DT is/VBZ a/DT single/JJ muscle/NN called/VBD the/DT psoas/NN major/NN and/CC because/IN it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB do/VB much/JJ work/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB tender/JJ ./. Since/CC there/RB is/VBZ only/RB 1/CD kg/NN of/IN it/PRP in/IN a/DT 500kg/JJ cattle/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB very/RB expensive/JJ ./. The/DT Tenderloin/NN is/VBZ situated/RB right/JJ next/JJ to/TO the/DT Sirloin/NN and/CC separated/NN by/IN a/DT thin/JJ bone/NN -LRB-/NN transverse/NN process/NN of/IN the/DT lumbar/JJ vertebra/NN -RRB-/NN ./. You/PRP get/VB a/DT T-Bone/NNP Steak/NNP when/WRB both/DT Sirloin/NN and/CC Tenderloin/NNS are/VBP cut/VB together/RB with/IN the/DT bone/NN ./. The/DT Tenderloin/NN gets/VBZ thicker/JJ nearer/NN to/TO the/DT rump/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT cow/NN and/CC a/DT T-bone/JJ steak/NN cut/NN from/IN this/DT region/NN is/VBZ sometimes/RB called/VBD a/DT Porterhouse/NN steak/NN ./. The/DT same/JJ Tenderloin/NN from/IN this/DT region/NN served/VBD without/IN the/DT bone/NN is/VBZ called/VBD a/DT Chateaubriand/JJ steak/NN which/WDT is/VBZ basically/RB the/DT thickest/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT Tenderloin/NN ./. I/PRP personally/VB do/VB n't/RB like/VB the/DT Tenderloin/NN because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ lack/NN of/IN flavor/NN ./. The/DT lack/NN of/IN marbling/VBG is/VBZ sometimes/RB rectified/JJ with/IN a/DT slice/NN of/IN bacon/NN wrapped/NN round/NN the/DT meat/NN in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN really/RB lean/JJ beef/NN ./. However/RB ,/, this/DT is/VBZ not/RB required/VBN in/IN the/DT Wagyu/NN since/IN it/PRP can/MD still/RB be/VB quite/RB marbled/JJ and/CC flavourful/JJ ./. However/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD rather/RB pay/VB less/JJ for/IN the/DT other/JJ cuts/NNS which/WRB are/VBP more/JJ flavourful/JJ and/CC leave/VB the/DT tenderloin/NN for/IN those/DT who/WP need/NN dentures/NN ./. Now/RB we/PRP move/VBD on/IN to/TO the/DT more/JJ interesting/JJ cuts/NNS ./. Let/DT 's/POS start/VB with/IN the/DT portion/NN of/IN the/DT cow/NN that/WDT is/VBZ just/RB behind/IN the/DT neck/NN ,/, a/DT large/JJ primal/NN known/VBN as/IN the/DT Chuck/NN ./. In/IN the/DT West/NN ,/, Chuck/NN is/VBZ not/RB traditionally/RB considered/IN prime/JJ meat/NN for/IN steaks/NNS ./. It/PRP is/VBZ usually/RB used/VBD for/IN stews/NN and/CC ground/NN to/TO make/VB hamburgers/NN ./. However/RB ,/, with/IN the/DT intensity/NN of/IN marbling/VBG in/IN the/DT Wagyu/NN cattle/NNS ,/, some/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT Chuck/NNS are/VBP actually/RB very/RB good/JJ for/IN Yakiniku/NNP and/CC are/VBP in/IN fact/NN considered/NNP Prime/NNP Yakiniku/NNP cuts/NNS ./. The/DT first/JJ cut/NN that/WDT we/PRP will/VB talk/VB about/IN is/VBZ the/DT Zabuton/NN which/WDT is/VBZ so/RB named/VBD because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ resemblance/NN to/TO the/DT flat/JJ Japanese/NN cushions/NN used/VBD for/IN sitting/VBG ./. This/DT cut/NN is/VBZ getting/VBG very/RB popular/JJ as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ tender/JJ and/CC flavourful/JJ ./. Go/VB into/IN any/DT respectable/NNP Yakiniku/NNP restaurant/NN and/CC you/PRP should/VB be/VB able/JJ to/TO ask/VB for/IN Zabuton/NN ./. The/DT Zabuton/NN is/VBZ cut/VBD from/IN the/DT Chuck/JJ Roll/NN which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT portion/NN of/IN the/DT Chuck/NN between/IN the/DT ribcage/NN and/CC the/DT shoulder/JJ blade/NN ./. Here/RB is/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ Video/NN showing/NN how/RB the/DT Chuck/NN Roll/NN is/VBZ divided/JJ into/IN the/DT Chuck/NNP Eye/NNP Roll/NN and/CC the/DT Chuck/JJ Underblade/NN ./. The/DT Zabuton/NN is/VBZ the/DT Chuck/NNP Underblade/NNP -LRB-/NNP aka/NNP Chuck/NNP flap/NNP -RRB-/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT serratus/JJ ventralis/NN muscle/NN attached/NN to/TO the/DT outside/JJ the/DT ribcage/NN ./. All/PDT these/DT muscles/NN which/WRB line/VBZ the/DT ribcage/NNS are/VBP excellent/JJ as/IN Karubi/JJ as/IN they/PRP have/VBP excellent/JJ flavor/NN and/CC well/RB marbled/RB ./. Rather/RB than/IN being/VBG just/RB tender/JJ and/CC juicy/JJ ,/, they/PRP have/VBN a/DT bit/NN more/RB bite/VB and/CC can/VB be/VB pleasantly/RB chewy/JJ ./. Another/DT very/RB popular/JJ Yakiniku/NNP cut/VBD taken/VBN from/IN the/DT Chuck/NN primal/NN is/VBZ the/DT Misuji/NN ./. This/DT cut/NN is/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO recognize/VB because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ shaped/JJ as/IN a/DT leaf/NN with/IN a/DT line/NN of/IN connective/NN tissue/NN in/IN the/DT center/NN ./. The/DT Misuji/NN is/VBZ also/RB cut/VB from/IN the/DT Chuck/JJ Primal/NN but/CC this/DT time/NN from/IN the/DT shoulder/NN clod/NN ./. -LRB-/JJ ie/IN outside/VBG the/DT shoulder/JJ blade/NN -RRB-/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT club/JJ shaped/NN muscle/NN that/WDT lies/VBZ next/JJ to/TO the/DT shoulder/JJ blade/NN known/VBN anatomically/NN as/IN the/DT supraspinatus/NNP -LRB-/NNP supra/NNP -/: above/NNP ,/, spinatus/NNP -/: spine/NNP -RRB-/NNP muscle/NNP ./. You/PRP might/VB sometimes/RB see/VB this/DT muscle/NN sold/VBD as/IN Chuck/JJ Tender/NN in/IN the/DT supermarkets/NN ./. The/DT muscle/NN on/IN the/DT other/JJ side/NN of/IN the/DT shoulder/JJ blade/NN just/RB separated/VBD by/IN a/DT thin/JJ bone/NN -LRB-/NN spine/NN -RRB-/NN is/VBZ the/DT infraspinatus/NNP -LRB-/NNP infra/NNP -/: below/IN -RRB-/JJ muscle/NN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT new/JJ cut/NN of/IN meat/NN marketed/NN as/IN the/DT Flat/NNP Iron/NNP Steak/NNP ./. This/DT meat/NN is/VBZ the/DT second/JJ most/NN tender/NN part/NN of/IN the/DT cattle/NNS after/IN the/DT Tenderloin/NN and/CC is/VBZ becoming/RB a/DT very/RB popular/JJ cut/NN ./. At/IN Magosabarou/NN ,/, they/PRP serve/VBP the/DT Misuji/NNP ``/NNP Yakishabu/NNP ''/NNP style/NN meaning/NN that/IN the/DT meat/NN is/VBZ sliced/VBN thin/JJ like/IN how/RB it/PRP would/MD be/VB cut/NN for/IN Shabu/NN Shabu/NN except/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ grilled/VBN instead/RB ,/, hence/IN the/DT name/NN ./. The/DT meat/NN is/VBZ amazingly/RB tender/JJ but/CC still/RB retains/RB some/JJ bite/VB and/CC has/VB a/DT nice/JJ sweetness/NN that/WDT is/VBZ released/RB when/WRB chewed/NN ./. Sankaku/JJ Karubi/NN is/VBZ considered/JJ to/TO be/VB the/DT ``/NNP King/NNP ''/NN of/IN Karubi/NN because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ outstanding/JJ marbling/VBG and/CC flavor/NN ./. This/DT meat/NN is/VBZ taken/VBN from/IN the/DT Chuck/JJ Short/NN Rib/NN which/WDT is/VBZ essentially/RB the/DT meat/NN attached/NN to/TO the/DT outside/NN of/IN the/DT ribcage/NN in/IN between/IN the/DT forelegs/NN of/IN the/DT cattle/NNS ./. This/DT cut/NN is/VBZ essentially/RB the/DT serratus/JJ ventralis/NN muscle/NN which/WRB lie/VBZ over/IN ribs/NNS 2/CD to/TO 5/CD ./. From/IN ribs/NNS 6/CD to/TO 12/CD the/DT same/JJ muscle/NN is/VBZ cut/VBD into/IN ``/NNP Short/NNP Ribs/NNP ''/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ part/NN of/IN the/DT Short/JJ Plate/NN primal/NN ./. The/DT Japanese/NN call/VBP it/PRP the/DT ``/NNP Sankaku/NNP ''/NNP -LRB-/NNP jap/NNP -/: 3/CD corners/NN -RRB-/NN Karubi/NN because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ triangular/JJ shape/NN ./. Needless/JJ to/TO say/VB ,/, the/DT Sankaku/NN Karubi/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/NN beautiful/NN and/CC distinct/NN slice/NN of/IN meat/NN that/IN you/PRP will/MD ever/RB get/VB in/IN Yakinku/NN ./. The/DT meat/NN is/VBZ tender/JJ ,/, bouncy/NN and/CC very/RB juicy/JJ ./. However/RB I/PRP did/VBD find/VB that/IN A5/NNP grade/NN Karubi/NN can/MD be/VB a/DT tad/NN too/RB rich/JJ and/CC would/MD prefer/VB something/NN with/IN a/DT bit/NN more/NN meat/NN ./. Having/VBG said/JJ that/WDT ,/, a/DT slice/NN or/CC two/CD of/IN Sankaku/NN Karubi/NN is/VBZ great/JJ to/TO have/VB with/IN some/NN of/IN the/DT other/JJ cuts/NNS ./. Conclusion/NN That/IN concludes/JJ part/NN one/CD of/IN the/DT Japanese/NNP Yakiniku/NNP cuts/NNS where/WRB we/PRP explore/VBD the/DT cuts/NNS of/IN meat/NN from/IN the/DT back/RB and/CC forequarters/NN of/IN the/DT cow/NN ./. In/IN part/NN two/CD ,/, we/PRP will/MD be/VB looking/VBG at/IN the/DT lower/JJR portion/NN as/IN well/RB as/IN the/DT hind/NN quarters/NN ./. The/DT meats/NNS in/IN these/DT portions/NNS may/MD be/VB foreign/JJ to/TO the/DT steak/NN lover/NN ,/, but/CC some/JJ of/IN them/PRP are/VBP excellent/JJ for/IN Yakiniku/NNP !/. In/IN the/DT meantime/NN ,/, if/IN you/PRP have/VBP a/DT need/NN for/IN meat/NN ,/, Magosabarou/NN is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ place/NN to/TO enjoy/VB a/DT Yakiniku/NNP meal/NN as/IN they/PRP butcher/VBD the/DT whole/JJ cow/NN so/IN you/PRP can/MD order/VB the/DT more/JJ exotic/NN and/CC rarer/NN cuts/NNS of/IN beef/NN ./.
