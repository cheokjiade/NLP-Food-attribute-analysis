<title>Empress Place Beef Kway Teow: Teochew Beef Kway Teow got no gravy one!</title>
<text>Did/VBP you/PRP realize/VB that/WDT most/NN of/IN the/DT hawker/NN food/NN that/IN we/PRP are/VBP familiar/JJ with/IN are/VBP less/JJ than/IN a/DT century/NN old/JJ ?/. It/PRP 's/VBZ true/JJ !/. A/DT few/JJ of/IN our/PRP$ most/NN famous/JJ heritage/NN stalls/NNS can/MD trace/VB their/PRP$ roots/NN back/RB to/TO around/IN the/DT early/NNP 1900/NNP 's/POS ./. That/DT makes/VBZ it/PRP about/IN 3/CD or/CC 4/CD generations/NNS from/IN then/RB till/NN now/RB ./. There/EX are/VBP a/DT few/JJ very/RB famous/JJ names/NN which/WDT have/VBZ span/VBN 3/CD or/CC 4/CD generations/NN and/CC inevitably/NN they/PRP would/MD have/VB created/VBN some/JJ sibling/NN rivalry/NN along/IN the/DT way/NN ./. Names/NNS like/IN Beach/NNP Road/NNP Prawn/NNP Noodle/NN and/CC Rochor/NN Bean/NN Curd/NN immediately/NN come/VB to/TO mind/VB ./. Then/RB of/IN course/NN there/RB is/VBZ the/DT famous/JJ Hock/NNP Lam/NNP Beef/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT subject/NN of/IN our/PRP$ discussion/JJ today/NN ./. Yes/EX ,/, the/DT man/NN who/WP made/VBD famous/JJ the/DT Teochew/NNP style/NN Beef/NN Kway/NNP Teow/NNP bestowed/IN the/DT business/NN to/TO his/PRP$ 4th/JJ son/NN ,/, Anthony/NN because/IN he/PRP did/VBD not/RB do/VB so/RB well/RB in/IN school/NN ./. But/CC later/RB on/IN the/DT youngest/NN son/NN also/RB wanted/VBD a/DT piece/NN of/IN the/DT ``/NNP Hock/NNP Lam/NNP ''/NNP name/NN ./. So/CC the/DT only/JJ legitimate/NN owner/NN of/IN the/DT Hock/JJ Lam/NN franchise/NN is/VBZ the/DT one/CD at/IN China/NNP St/NNP whereas/IN the/DT ``/NNP Popular/NNP ''/NNP Hock/NNP Lam/NNP Beef/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP at/IN Purvis/NNP street/NN is/VBZ considered/RB the/DT illegitimate/JJ one/CD though/IN both/DT are/VBP brothers/JJ and/CC thus/RB share/VB in/IN the/DT family/NN recipe/NN ./. But/CC that/WDT is/VBZ not/RB all/RB ,/, the/DT patriarch/NN ,/, Mr/NNP Tan/NNP Chin/NNP Sia/NNP also/RB had/VBD a/DT daughter/NN who/WP also/RB decided/VBD to/TO go/VB into/IN the/DT Beef/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP business/NN ,/, but/CC she/PRP started/VBD selling/VBG it/PRP at/IN Empress/NN Place/NN and/CC called/VBD hers/NN Empress/NN Place/NN Beef/NN Kway/NNP Teow/NNP instead/RB ./. It/PRP did/VBD very/RB well/RB ,/, but/CC unfortunately/PRP had/VBD to/TO close/VB down/VB during/IN the/DT MadCow/JJ epidemic/NN in/IN the/DT late/NN eighties/NN ./. Fortunately/JJ for/IN us/PRP ,/, the/DT Brand/NN was/VBD resurrected/RB again/RB in/IN few/JJ years/NNS ago/RB when/WRB her/PRP son/RB decided/VBD to/TO bring/VB back/RB the/DT familiar/JJ Beef/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP that/WDT he/PRP used/VBD to/TO eat/VB at/IN his/PRP$ grandfather/NN 's/POS stall/NN ./. So/RB much/JJ for/IN that/WDT little/JJ bit/NN of/IN Beef/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP history/NN ,/, back/RB to/TO a/DT more/JJ tasty/JJ subject/NN ./. Have/VB you/PRP ever/RB wondered/VBN why/WRB Beef/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP is/VBZ called/VBD Kway/NNP Teow/NNP even/RB though/IN most/NN of/IN the/DT time/NN you/PRP eat/VB it/PRP with/IN thick/NN bee/NN hoon/NN ?/. Well/RB ,/, there/RB are/VBP really/RB two/CD types/NNS of/IN Beef/NNP Kway/NNP Teow/NNP in/IN the/DT market/NN ,/, the/DT Hainanese/NNP style/NN and/CC the/DT Teochew/NNP Style/NNP ./. The/DT familiar/JJ one/CD with/IN the/DT thick/JJ bee/NN hoon/NN and/CC thick/NN sticky/NN gravy/NN is/VBZ in/IN fact/NN Hainanese/NNP style/NN ./. According/VBG to/TO David/NN ,/, there/RB are/VBP very/RB few/JJ stalls/NNS apart/RB from/IN his/PRP$ that/WDT sells/VBZ true/JJ blue/JJ Teochew/NNP style/NN beef/NN kway/NN teow/NN ./. True/NNP Teochew/NNP beef/NN kway/NN teow/NN is/VBZ never/RB served/VBD with/IN thick/NN bee/NN hoon/NN and/CC there/RB is/VBZ never/RB any/RB thick/JJ gravy/NN ./. David/DT said/JJ that/IN his/PRP$ Grandfather/NN will/MD turn/VB in/IN his/PRP$ grave/NN if/IN he/PRP realized/VBZ what/WP had/VBD happened/VBD to/TO his/PRP$ Hock/JJ Lam/NN St/NN beef/NN kway/NN teow/NN ./. Instead/NNP ,/, Teochew/NNP style/NN beef/NN kway/NN teow/NN uses/VBZ normal/JJ kway/NN teow/NN and/CC the/DT dry/JJ version/NN is/VBZ served/VBD with/IN just/RB a/DT dash/NN of/IN sesame/NN oil/NN ,/, soy/NN sauce/NN and/CC chilli/NN ./. Now/RB I/PRP was/VBD skeptical/JJ at/IN first/JJ ,/, but/CC with/IN my/PRP$ first/JJ mouthful/NN of/IN the/DT kway/NN teow/NN ,/, I/PRP realized/VBP what/WP I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN missing/VBG ./. The/DT kway/NN teow/NN was/VBD indeed/RB very/RB fragrant/JJ and/CC the/DT slices/NNS of/IN beef/NN were/VBD cooked/VBN medium/NN and/CC were/VBD very/RB tender/JJ ./. Unexpectedly/RB good/JJ !/. My/PRP$ favorite/NN was/VBD the/DT cooked/VBN beef/NN and/CC the/DT tendons/NN which/WDT were/VBD very/RB ``/JJ pang/NN ''/NN and/CC had/VBD an/DT uncomplicated/JJ beefy/NN flavor/NN ./. The/DT soup/NN was/VBD also/RB sweet/JJ and/CC robust/NN which/WRB David/VBZ attributes/NN to/TO having/VBG the/DT bones/NNS simmer/VBD in/IN the/DT soup/NN for/IN over/IN 2/CD days/NNS ./. I/PRP tend/VBD to/TO believe/VB that/IN Teochew/NNP beef/NN kway/NN teow/NN was/VBD originally/RB served/VBN this/DT way/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN kway/NN teow/NN is/VBZ used/VBD and/CC also/RB that/IN the/DT Teochews/NN in/IN general/NN prefer/VB most/NN of/IN their/PRP$ food/NN to/TO be/VB ``/JJ cheng/NN ''/NN -LRB-/VBD not/RB heavy/JJ -RRB-/NN ./. So/CC the/DT sticky/JJ gravy/NN I/PRP think/VB is/VBZ more/RB likely/JJ to/TO be/VB Hainanese/NNP in/IN origin/NNP ./. Any/RB food/NN historians/NN amongst/NN our/JJ readers/NNS who/WP can/MD shed/VB more/RB light/JJ on/IN this/DT ?/. </text>
