<title>Xi Le Teng Dessert Stall: 70 year old lady, 70 cents dessert</title>
<text>Red/JJ Bean/NN Soup/NN always/RB reminds/VBD me/PRP of/IN my/PRP$ kindergarten/NN days/NNS at/IN the/DT PAP/NN ./. It/PRP 's/POS nostalgic/NN in/IN a/DT sort/NN of/IN a/DT bad/JJ way/NN `/NN cos/NN I/PRP always/RB remember/VB it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT worst/JJ red/JJ bean/NN soup/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ./. Rather/JJ than/IN having/VBG whole/JJ beans/NNS or/CC even/RB half/JJ beans/NNS ,/, it/PRP 's/POS just/RB the/DT shell/NN of/IN the/DT red/JJ beans/NNS in/IN a/DT big/JJ bowl/NN of/IN rather/RB translucent/JJ sweet/JJ water/NN that/WDT has/VBZ a/DT tinge/NN of/IN red/JJ in/IN it/PRP ./. Red/JJ Bean/NN Soup/NN must/VB be/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT simplest/JJ desserts/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN to/TO prepare/VB which/WRB probably/RB explains/VB why/WRB the/DT Aunty/NN at/IN the/DT PAP/NN prepares/IN it/PRP every/DT week/NN ./. Plus/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ cheap/JJ ./. There/EX are/VBP really/RB only/RB three/CD ingredients/NNS that/IN you/PRP need/VBP and/CC they/PRP are/VBP Red/JJ Beans/NN ,/, water/NN and/CC sugar/NN ./. But/CC of/IN course/NN you/PRP could/MD make/VB it/PRP a/DT little/JJ more/JJ special/JJ by/IN flavoring/VBG it/PRP with/IN pandan/PRP leaves/VBZ or/RB dried/JJ orange/JJ peel/NN ./. The/DT more/NN sophisticated/NN would/MD add/VB sago/JJ and/CC dried/JJ longans/NN in/IN it/PRP ./. But/CC for/IN the/DT PAP/NN kindergarten/NN ,/, water/NN ,/, sugar/NN and/CC Red/NN Beans/NNS are/VBP all/PDT the/DT ingredients/NNS they/PRP used/VBD ./. -LRB-/JJ In/IN descending/JJ order/NN of/IN quantity/NN -RRB-/. But/CC when/WRB you/PRP talk/VB about/IN the/DT essential/JJ Red/NN Bean/NN Soup/NN ,/, there/RB really/RB are/VBP only/RB two/CD types/NNS ./. There/EX is/VBZ the/DT type/NN where/WRB you/PRP simply/VB boil/VB the/DT beans/NNS in/IN water/NN to/TO get/VB a/DT grainy/NN soup/NN with/IN broken/JJ beans/NNS ,/, ie/IN the/DT ones/NNS that/IN mom/NN used/VBD to/TO make/VB ./. Then/RB there/RB are/VBP the/DT ones/NNS that/WDT have/VBN nice/JJ tender/JJ whole/JJ beans/NNS in/IN a/DT red/JJ cloudy/NN soup/NN ,/, ie/IN those/DT that/WDT you/PRP buy/VB at/IN the/DT hawker/NN center/NN ./. Both/NNS are/VBP nice/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP think/VB that/WDT the/DT latter/NN ,/, ie/IN the/DT whole/JJ beans/NNS type/NN take/VB a/DT little/JJ more/NN skill/NN to/TO prepare/VB ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT classic/JJ Red/NN Bean/NN Soup/NN sold/VBD at/IN old/JJ dessert/NN stalls/NNS such/JJ as/IN this/DT one/CD which/WDT has/VBZ fed/RB our/JJ friend/NN SCS/NN Butter/NN since/IN the/DT days/NNS before/IN he/PRP was/VBD even/RB churned/JJ into/IN cream/NN ./. The/DT little/JJ old/JJ lady/NN at/IN the/DT stall/NN has/VBZ been/VBN cooking/JJ the/DT same/JJ old/JJ Red/NN Bean/NN Soup/NN for/IN 40/CD years/NNS ./. When/WRB she/PRP first/RB started/VBD ,/, she/PRP was/VBD probably/RB a/DT head/NN taller/NN and/CC wearing/NN horn-rimmed/NN spectacles/NN and/CC a/DT beehive/JJ hairdo/NN ./. She/DT is/VBZ so/RB old/JJ school/NN that/WDT she/PRP is/VBZ still/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ ladies/NNS around/IN who/WP still/RB like/VB to/TO wear/NNP sleeveless/NNP grandma/NNP clothes/NNP ./. Hey/UH ,/, you/PRP might/VB say/VB ``/. But/CC she/PRP is/VBZ a/DT grandma/NN what/WP !/. ''/RB but/CC you/PRP know/VBP ,/, she/PRP is/VBZ old/JJ fashioned/NN by/IN today/NN 's/POS grandma/NN standards/NN ./. My/PRP$ mom/NN and/CC mom-in-law/NNS are/VBP both/DT grandmas/NN and/CC they/PRP certainly/RB wo/VBP n't/RB wear/VB sleeveless/JJ granny/NN clothes/NN ./. Anyway/RB ,/, I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP am/VBP getting/VBG too/RB carried/JJ away/RB ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG for/IN some/DT old/JJ fashioned/NN sweet/JJ soups/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ one/CD place/NN you/PRP can/MD certainly/RB head/NN for/IN ./. The/DT old/JJ lady/NN makes/VBZ four/RB different/JJ soups/NN ./. Red/JJ Bean/NN ,/, White/NNP Oats/NNP ,/, Green/NNP Beans/NNP with/IN Sago/NN and/CC Cheng/NN Tng/NN ./. They/PRP are/VBP all/DT very/RB old/JJ school/NN ,/, very/RB good/JJ and/CC at/IN 70/NN cents/NN a/DT bowl/NN ,/, very/RB cheap/JJ ./. Conclusion/NN In/IN a/DT place/NN like/IN Singapore/NNP where/WRB everything/NN seems/VBZ to/TO change/NN too/RB fast/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ good/JJ to/TO know/VB that/WDT there/EX are/VBP hawkers/NNS who/WP do/VBP n't/RB want/VB to/TO change/NN anything/NN ,/, even/RB their/PRP$ prices/NNS ./.
