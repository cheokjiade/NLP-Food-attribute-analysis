<title>Ariston OpenSpace Oven: Ieat's Chiffon Tin Crispy Roast Chicken Recipe</title>
<text>This/DT Recipe/NN was/VBD brought/VBN to/TO you/PRP by/IN Mayer/NN ,/, the/DT Kitchen/JJ Speclialist/NN Exclusive/NN offer/VB for/IN ieatishootipost/NN readers/NNS at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT post/NN There/RB are/VBP many/JJ recipes/NN for/IN Roast/NNP Chicken/NNP on/IN the/DT internet/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB come/VB across/IN one/CD which/WDT deals/VBD with/IN the/DT Chinese/NNP Style/NNP Crispy/NNP Roast/NNP Chicken/NN which/WRB I/PRP love/VBP to/TO eat/VB at/IN Cantonese/NNP restaurants/NN ./. So/CC I/PRP hope/VBP this/DT recipe/NN will/MD be/VB useful/NN for/IN anyone/PRP who/WP wants/VBZ to/TO make/VB this/DT yummy/JJ dish/NN at/IN home/NN ./. Typically/JJ ,/, the/DT roast/NN chicken/NN that/WDT you/PRP buy/VB outside/NN is/VBZ not/RB really/RB roasted/JJ ./. The/DT whole/JJ chicken/NN is/VBZ actually/RB deep/JJ fried/VBD in/IN oil/NN ./. Doing/DT this/DT at/IN home/NN is/VBZ not/RB practical/JJ as/IN there/RB is/VBZ a/DT lot/NN of/IN wastage/NN ./. With/IN this/DT recipe/NN ,/, the/DT chicken/NN is/VBZ first/JJ roasted/NN at/IN a/DT low/JJ temperature/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT meat/NN does/VBZ not/RB lose/VB its/PRP$ juices/NNS and/CC then/RB the/DT skin/NN is/VBZ browned/JJ to/TO give/VB it/PRP that/IN crispy/NN bronzed/NN skin/NN ./. My/PRP$ new/JJ Ariston/NNP OpenSpace/NNP Oven/. I/PRP have/VBP just/RB swapped/VB my/PRP$ old/JJ oven/NN for/IN a/DT brand/NN new/JJ Ariston/NN Openspace/NN oven/NN and/CC so/RB I/PRP have/VBN been/VBN doing/VBG a/DT few/JJ kitchen/NN experiments/NN with/IN my/PRP$ new/JJ gadget/NN ./. Essentially/IN the/DT oven/NN gives/VBZ me/PRP a/DT 20/CD %/: increase/NNP in/IN the/DT internal/JJ space/NN while/IN the/DT external/NN dimension/NN is/VBZ still/RB the/DT same/JJ ./. That/DT means/NN that/IN I/PRP simply/VBD swapped/IN my/PRP$ standard/JJ 58/NN litre/NN oven/NN for/IN a/DT 70/JJ litre/NN one/CD without/IN having/VBG to/TO do/VB any/RB alteration/VBD to/TO my/PRP$ Kitchen/NN furniture/NN ./. The/DT oven/NN can/MD be/VB divided/VBD into/IN two/CD separate/NN compartments/NN ,/, a/DT smaller/JJ 20/CD litre/NNS on/IN top/JJ where/WRB you/PRP can/MD bake/NN and/CC grill/NN and/CC a/DT larger/JJ 48/NN litre/NN compartment/NN on/IN the/DT bottom/NN for/IN baking/NN ./. Both/JJ compartments/NNS have/VBP their/PRP$ own/JJ controls/NN so/IN you/PRP can/MD actually/RB grill/VB something/NN in/IN the/DT top/JJ compartment/NN while/NN baking/IN another/DT item/NN in/IN the/DT bottom/NN ./. With/IN this/DT flexibility/JJ ,/, I/PRP was/VBD able/JJ to/TO roast/NN a/DT chicken/NN in/IN the/DT bottom/NN compartment/NN and/CC bake/NN some/NN cornbread/NN at/IN the/DT top/JJ ./. The/DT individual/NN controls/NN meant/NN that/IN I/PRP can/MD vary/VB the/DT temperature/NN when/WRB I/PRP am/VBP roasting/VBG the/DT chicken/NN while/NN keeping/VBG a/DT constant/JJ temperature/NN for/IN the/DT cornbread/NN !/. The/DT oven/NN can/MD be/VB converted/VBD to/TO a/DT single/JJ 70/NN litre/NN oven/NN by/IN simply/NN removing/IN the/DT divider/NN ,/, giving/VBG one/CD big/JJ space/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB used/VBD to/TO roast/NN a/DT Turkey/NN or/CC a/DT Duck/NN vertically/NN if/IN you/PRP wish/VBP or/RB simply/JJ to/TO bake/NN enough/JJ muffins/NN to/TO feed/VB a/DT small/JJ school/NN of/IN hungry/JJ kids/NNS !/. Cooking/JJ Temperature/NN for/IN Chicken/NN The/DT recommendation/NN for/IN cooking/NN whole/JJ chicken/NN as/IN stated/JJ by/IN the/DT USDA/NN is/VBZ 85/JJ degrees/NNS Celsius/RB ./. As/CC with/IN all/DT government/NN recommendations/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ done/VBN to/TO give/VB a/DT wide/JJ margin/NN of/IN error/NN ./. -LRB-/NNP Singlish/NNP :/: Kia/NNP Su/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. Meat/NNP proteins/NNP denature/NNP at/IN 55-65/NNP degrees/NNS ./. ie/IN once/RB your/PRP$ meat/NN reaches/JJ 65/NN degrees/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ essentially/RB cooked/VBN ./. But/CC with/IN chicken/NN the/DT concern/NN is/VBZ Salmonella/RB ./. Salmonella/DT is/VBZ killed/VBN at/IN 55/CD degrees/NNS ,/, but/CC you/PRP have/VBP to/TO hold/VB that/IN temperature/NN for/IN a/DT while/NN ./. The/DT consensus/NN is/VBZ to/TO cook/VB your/PRP$ meat/NN to/TO 65/VB degrees/NNS for/IN 10/CD minutes/NN or/CC 70/NN degrees/NNS for/IN 2/CD minutes/NNS ./. At/IN these/DT temperatures/NNS you/PRP essentially/RB kill/VB all/DT the/DT bacteria/NN ./. But/CC the/DT trick/NN is/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT whole/JJ chicken/NN is/VBZ cooked/VBN to/TO that/WDT temperature/NN ./. Hence/IN the/DT USDA/JJ recomendations/NN to/TO totally/RB annihilate/IN the/DT bacteria/NN by/IN cooking/NN to/TO 74/VB degrees/NNS for/IN chicken/NN pieces/NN and/CC 85/NN degrees/NNS for/IN a/DT whole/JJ chicken/NN ./. Aside/RB from/IN making/VBG sure/JJ that/WDT the/DT Salmonella/NN is/VBZ killed/VBN ,/, the/DT right/JJ cooking/NN temperature/NN is/VBZ also/RB required/VBN for/IN tender/NN meat/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ recommended/JJ to/TO cook/VB the/DT thighs/NN to/TO 85/VB degrees/NNS because/IN you/PRP needed/VBP a/DT higher/NN temperature/NN to/TO break/VB down/IN the/DT connective/JJ tissue/NN in/IN the/DT thigh/NN meat/NN ./. But/CC that/WDT is/VBZ only/RB applicable/JJ if/IN you/PRP are/VBP using/VBG a/DT real/JJ kampung/NN or/CC free/JJ range/NN chicken/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP using/VBG the/DT normal/JJ battery/NN hens/NN ,/, the/DT thigh/NN meat/NN does/VBZ not/RB have/VB enough/JJ connective/NN tissue/NN to/TO be/VB tough/NN ,/, so/RB you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB need/VB to/TO cook/VB it/PRP to/TO 85/VB degrees/NNS ./. For/IN the/DT purpose/NN of/IN my/PRP$ roast/NN chicken/NN ,/, I/PRP try/VB to/TO get/VB an/DT internal/JJ temperature/NN of/IN 70/JJ degrees/NNS as/IN it/PRP ensures/VBZ that/IN the/DT meat/NN is/VBZ safe/JJ to/TO eat/VB and/CC as/IN long/JJ as/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB hold/VB it/PRP too/RB long/JJ beyond/NN that/IN temperature/NN ,/, the/DT chicken/NN will/MD be/VB nice/JJ ,/, juicy/JJ and/CC safe/JJ to/TO eat/VB ./. I/PRP started/VBD researching/VBG for/IN the/DT best/JJS way/NN to/TO roast/NN a/DT chicken/NN by/IN watching/VBG Heston/NNP Blumenthal/NNP 's/POS perfect/JJ roast/NN chicken/NN recipe/NN ./. He/PRP defined/VBZ a/DT perfect/JJ roast/NN chicken/NN as/IN having/VBG crispy/NN skin/NN with/IN juicy/JJ and/CC flavourful/JJ breast/NN meat/NN ./. In/IN order/NN to/TO do/VB this/DT ,/, first/JJ he/PRP got/VBD himself/PRP a/DT Poularde/JJ de/NNP Bresse/NNP -LRB-/NNP expensive/NNP French/NNP chicken/NN raised/NNS in/IN five/CD star/NN resort/NN -RRB-/NN ,/, which/WRB he/PRP brines/VBD in/IN a/DT 8/CD %/: salt/NN solution/NN ./. Next/CC he/PRP parboils/VBZ the/DT chicken/NN for/IN 30/CD seconds/NNS to/TO kill/VB the/DT bacteria/NN and/CC then/RB dries/VB the/DT skin/NN by/IN placing/NN in/IN the/DT fridge/NN ./. The/DT drying/NN of/IN the/DT skin/NN will/MD ensure/VB a/DT crispy/JJ skin/NN ./. He/PRP then/RB cooks/VBD the/DT chicken/NN for/IN 4/CD and/CC a/DT half/JJ hours/NNS at/IN 60/CD degrees/NNS C/NN ,/, then/RB browns/IN the/DT skin/NN on/IN a/DT skillet/NN before/IN injected/VBG the/DT breast/NN meat/NN with/IN butter/NN which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN flavored/RB by/IN frying/VBG it/PRP with/IN the/DT cut/NN wing/NN tips/NN ./. Now/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO impress/VB your/PRP$ wife/NN on/IN your/PRP$ first/JJ wedding/NN anniversary/NN ,/, that/PRP 's/VBZ fine/JJ ./. Otherwise/JJ ,/, I/PRP think/VB for/IN practical/NN home/NN cooking/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ impractical/NN and/CC most/NN of/IN us/PRP will/MD stumble/VB at/IN the/DT Poularde/JJ de/NN Bresse/NN stage/NN ./. So/CC I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO do/VB something/NN practical/JJ but/CC still/RB employing/VBD some/NN of/IN Heston/NN 's/POS techniques/NN to/TO achieve/VB a/DT Crispy/NNP Roast/NNP Chicken/NNP like/IN they/PRP serve/VBP in/IN Cantonese/JJ restaurants/NN ./. A/DT lot/NN of/IN people/NN I/PRP spoke/VBD to/TO experience/NN a/DT common/JJ problem/NN with/IN roast/NN chicken/NN and/CC that/WDT is/VBZ that/IN the/DT breast/NN of/IN the/DT chicken/NN gets/VBZ too/RB dry/JJ when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ cooked/VBN ./. This/DT happens/VBZ because/IN the/DT juices/NNS from/IN within/VBG the/DT muscle/JJ fibers/NN of/IN the/DT breast/NN meat/NN starts/VBZ to/TO get/VB squeezed/VBD out/RP when/WRB it/PRP reaches/RB 68/JJ degrees/NNS Celsius/RB ./. The/DT typical/NN way/NN of/IN roasting/VBG a/DT chicken/NN is/VBZ to/TO place/NN the/DT bird/NN on/IN the/DT roasting/NN tray/NN and/CC roast/NN at/IN 200/JJ degrees/NNS for/IN 40/CD -/: 60/CD minutes/NNS ./. The/DT problem/NN with/IN this/DT method/NN is/VBZ that/WDT at/IN the/DT beginning/VBG ,/, the/DT temperature/NN outside/IN the/DT bird/NN is/VBZ 200/JJ degrees/NNS ,/, while/IN the/DT temperature/NN in/IN the/DT cavity/NN is/VBZ 25/CD degrees/NNS ./. So/CC the/DT heat/NN has/VBZ to/TO penetrate/VB slowly/NN through/IN the/DT chicken/NN ./. By/CC the/DT time/NN the/DT inside/NN of/IN the/DT chicken/NN reaches/NN 68/NN degrees/NNS ,/, the/DT outside/NN has/VBZ gone/JJ way/NN beyond/NN that/IN temperature/NN and/CC so/RB the/DT breast/NN meat/NN is/VBZ dry/JJ and/CC unexciting/JJ ./. So/CC the/DT principle/NN is/VBZ to/TO try/VB to/TO cook/VB the/DT chicken/NN at/IN a/DT gentler/JJ temperature/NN and/CC minimize/VBD the/DT temperature/NN gradient/NN between/IN the/DT outside/NN and/CC the/DT inside/NN of/IN the/DT chicken/NN ./. You/PRP can/VB of/IN course/NN achieve/IN this/DT simply/NN by/IN cutting/VBG the/DT chicken/NN in/IN half/NN and/CC roasting/VB it/PRP that/WDT way/NN ,/, but/CC a/DT whole/JJ roasted/JJ chicken/NN is/VBZ more/RB sexy/JJ when/WRB you/PRP present/VB it/PRP on/IN the/DT table/NN ./. The/DT Chiffon/NN Tin/NN Gadget/. I/PRP had/VBD initially/RB wanted/VBD to/TO try/VB the/DT beer/NN can/NN chicken/NN cooking/NN technique/NN because/IN I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD a/DT great/JJ concept/NN to/TO have/VB the/DT cavity/NN of/IN the/DT chicken/NN cooked/VBN with/IN the/DT boiling/JJ beer/NN ./. But/CC I/PRP am/VBP not/RB a/DT beer/NN drinker/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP looked/VBD in/IN my/PRP$ cupboard/NN and/CC found/VBD that/IN the/DT inner/NN tube/NN of/IN my/PRP$ chiffon/NN cake/NN tin/NN worked/VBD even/RB better/JJR than/IN a/DT beer/NN can/NN as/IN it/PRP had/VBD a/DT base/NN for/IN the/DT chicken/NN to/TO rest/NN on/IN ./. Placing/DT this/DT over/RB a/DT small/JJ cake/NN tin/NN filled/VBD with/IN boiling/JJ water/NN from/IN the/DT kettle/NN was/VBD a/DT good/JJ way/NN of/IN keeping/VBG getting/VBG the/DT cavity/NN of/IN the/DT chicken/NN to/TO a/DT temperature/NN of/IN 100/CD degrees/NNS C./IN -LRB-/NN Boiling/NN point/NN of/IN water/NN -RRB-/NN With/IN the/DT Openspace/NN oven/NN ,/, I/PRP have/VB the/DT flexibility/JJ to/TO actually/RB bake/NN some/NN cornbread/NN at/IN a/DT different/JJ temperature/NN while/IN I/PRP am/VBP roasting/VBG the/DT chicken/NN ./. The/DT two/CD compartments/NNS have/VBP their/PRP$ own/JJ temperature/NN control/NN ./. So/RB while/IN I/PRP am/VBP roasting/VBG my/PRP$ chicken/NN at/IN 220/NN degrees/NNS ,/, I/PRP was/VBD baking/IN my/PRP$ cornbread/NN at/IN 190/JJ degrees/NNS !/. -LRB-/NNP Note/NNP :/. The/DT difference/NN range/NN is/VBZ limited/JJ to/TO 50/CD degrees/NNS -RRB-/RB Plus/VB if/IN I/PRP was/VBD just/RB roasting/JJ chicken/NN ,/, I/PRP actually/RB save/VBD on/IN electricity/NN as/IN I/PRP only/RB use/VB the/DT bottom/JJ compartment/NN ./. There/EX is/VBZ an/DT insulator/NN that/IN divides/JJ the/DT oven/NN into/IN two/CD compartments/NNS ./. If/IN you/PRP remove/VB the/DT insulator/NN ,/, then/RB the/DT whole/JJ oven/NN can/MD be/VB used/VBD to/TO say/VB roast/NN a/DT whole/JJ turkey/NN upright/NN !/. All/PDT in/IN all/NN ,/, I/PRP found/VBD the/DT flexibility/JJ and/CC the/DT extra/JJ space/NN very/RB useful/RB ./. My/PRP$ Recipe/NN for/IN the/DT Crispy/NNP Roast/NNP Chicken/NN Many/JJ chickens/NN had/VBD to/TO be/VB sacrificed/NN for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN this/DT post/NN and/CC I/PRP always/RB have/VBN to/TO come/VB up/RP with/IN new/JJ flavors/NNS for/IN the/DT chicken/NN so/RB that/IN my/PRP$ kids/NNS do/VBP n't/RB complain/VB too/RB much/JJ ./. There/EX are/VBP many/JJ flavors/NNS which/WRB I/PRP experimented/VBD with/IN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ really/RB up/VB to/TO you/PRP if/IN you/PRP want/VB to/TO season/VB the/DT chicken/NN with/IN just/RB salt/NN and/CC pepper/NN and/CC baste/VB the/DT chicken/NN with/IN butter/NN or/CC if/IN you/PRP want/VB to/TO go/VB the/DT way/NN of/IN marinating/VBG it/PRP with/IN satay/NN spices/NNS ./. However/RB ,/, I/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO post/VB something/NN that/WDT no/RB one/CD else/RB has/VBZ posted/VBN on/IN the/DT net/NN ,/, so/RB I/PRP asked/VBD Francis/RB from/IN Cafe/NNP de/NNP Hong/NNP Kong/NNP for/IN his/PRP$ fabulous/JJ Roast/NNP Chicken/NNP recipe/NN ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT crispy/JJ skinned/NN bronzed/NN chicken/NN that/IN I/PRP love/VBP to/TO eat/VB at/IN chinese/NN restaurants/NN ./. Actually/RB Roast/NNP Chicken/NNP is/VBZ a/DT misnomer/JJ since/IN the/DT chicken/NN is/VBZ actually/RB deep/JJ fried/VBD ./. But/CC not/RB many/JJ of/IN us/PRP would/MD want/VB to/TO heat/NN up/IN a/DT whole/JJ pot/NN of/IN oil/NN just/RB to/TO deep/VB fry/VB one/CD chicken/NN ,/, so/RB here/RB is/VBZ my/PRP$ modified/JJ home/NN version/NN :/: 1/CD ./. Brining/VBG the/DT Chicken/NNP -LRB-/NNP Optional/NNP Step/NNP -RRB-/. This/DT step/NN is/VBZ optional/JJ for/IN chickens/JJ but/CC essential/JJ for/IN turkeys/NN ./. Heston/DT brines/NN his/PRP$ chicken/NN in/IN a/DT 8/CD %/: salt/NN solution/NN ie/IN 80g/JJ salt/NN per/NN litre/NN of/IN water/NN for/IN 4/CD hours/NNS ./. Brining/VBG will/MD make/VB the/DT chicken/NN more/NN juicy/JJ and/CC introduce/JJ some/NN taste/NN into/IN the/DT meat/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBP tried/VBN brining/JJ but/CC found/JJ that/IN the/DT extra/JJ effort/NN is/VBZ not/RB really/RB worth/IN the/DT trouble/NN ./. However/RB ,/, I/PRP like/VB that/PRP slightly/RB salty/NN flavor/NN in/IN my/PRP$ chicken/NN ,/, so/RB what/WP I/PRP do/VBP now/RB is/VBZ to/TO use/VB a/DT solution/NN made/VBD from/IN 1\/2/JJ cup/NN Soy/NN Sauce/NN and/CC 1\/2/NN cup/NN water/NN as/IN the/DT brining/NN solution/NN and/CC marinade/VB the/DT whole/JJ chicken/NN in/IN a/DT sealable/JJ plastic/NN bag/NN overnight/JJ with/IN all/DT the/DT air/NN evacuated/NN so/RB that/IN the/DT whole/JJ chicken/NN is/VBZ in/IN contact/NN with/IN the/DT solution/NN ./. Try/VB to/TO use/VB a/DT good/JJ soy/NN sauce/NN like/IN Kikkoman/NN Special/JJ Fragrance/NN Soy/NN Sauce/NN as/IN it/PRP give/VB it/PRP better/NN flavor/NN ./. I/PRP find/VB that/WDT brining/VBZ this/DT way/NN gives/VBZ it/PRP that/IN juiciness/NN and/CC flavor/NN but/CC does/VBZ n't/RB take/VB up/IN too/RB much/JJ space/NN in/IN the/DT fridge/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP wish/VBP ,/, you/PRP can/MD also/RB add/VB some/DT coriander/JJ root/NN to/TO give/VB it/PRP a/DT nice/JJ aroma/NN ./. 2/CD ./. Preparing/IN the/DT skin/NN and/CC marinating/VB the/DT chicken/NN This/DT particular/JJ step/NN is/VBZ the/DT important/JJ step/NN if/IN you/PRP wish/VBP to/TO get/VB that/IN golden/NN brown/JJ skin/NN that/WDT you/PRP see/VB in/IN Chinese/NNP restaurants/NN ./. After/IN the/DT optional/JJ brining/NN step/NN ,/, wash/IN the/DT chicken/NN and/CC then/RB parboil/VB it/PRP for/IN half/NN a/DT minute/NN and/CC cool/VB it/PRP in/IN cold/JJ water/NN ./. Repeat/DT this/DT step/NN again/RB and/CC then/RB pat/RB dry/JJ ./. Season/IN the/DT cavity/NN fo/IN the/DT chicken/NN with/IN 1/CD tbl/NN salt/NN ,/, 2/CD teaspoon/NNS of/IN white/JJ pepper/NN and/CC a/DT pinch/NN of/IN 5/CD spice/NN powder/NN ./. Now/RB you/PRP need/VB to/TO make/VB the/DT browning/JJ solution/NN ./.

Next/CC apply/RB this/DT solution/NN over/IN the/DT whole/JJ chicken/NN and/CC let/VB it/PRP air/RB dry/JJ for/IN at/IN least/RB 3/CD hours/NNS or/CC overnight/JJ in/IN the/DT fridge/NN loosely/NN covered/NN with/IN baking/NN paper/NN ./. 3/CD ./. Cooking/IN the/DT chicken/NN Option/NNS A./IN 100/CD degree/NN Chicken/NN With/IN my/PRP$ chiffon/NN tin/NN gadget/NN ,/, I/PRP experimented/VBD with/IN different/JJ cooking/NN temperatures/NNS and/CC cooking/JJ times/NNS ./. The/DT key/NN is/VBZ to/TO cook/VB the/DT chicken/NN to/TO 70/VB degrees/NNS and/CC there/RB are/VBP various/JJ ways/NN to/TO do/VB this/DT ./. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP the/DT patient/NN type/NN ./. You/PRP should/VB go/VB low/JJ and/CC slow/JJ by/IN cooking/NN the/DT chicken/NN just/RB below/IN 100/CD degrees/NNS ./. This/DT is/VBZ the/DT temperature/NN that/IN they/PRP poach/JJ chicken/NN in/IN chicken/NN rice/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN for/IN the/DT skin/NN to/TO start/VB browning/NN ,/, the/DT Maillard/NN reaction/NN has/VBZ to/TO occur/VB and/CC you/PRP need/VB temperatures/NNS in/IN excess/NN of/IN 120/JJ degrees/NNS before/IN that/PRP happens/VBZ ./.
