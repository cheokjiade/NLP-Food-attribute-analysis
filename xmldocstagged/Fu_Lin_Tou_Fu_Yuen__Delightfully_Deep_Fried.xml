<title>Fu Lin Tou Fu Yuen: Delightfully Deep Fried</title>
<text>I/PRP usually/RB end/VB up/IN eating/VBG Yong/NNP Tau/NNP Foo/NNP when/WRB I/PRP feel/VB that/WDT I/PRP want/VB something/NN that/WDT is/VBZ reasonably/RB tasty/JJ yet/RB healthy/JJ ./. So/CC the/DT idea/NN of/IN a/DT big/JJ bowl/NN of/IN soup/NN with/IN Toufu/NN ,/, vegetables/NNS and/CC other/JJ stuff/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN blanched/VBN in/IN water/NN seems/VBZ to/TO me/PRP a/DT good/JJ idea/NN for/IN healthy/JJ food/NN ./. Of/IN course/NN ,/, if/IN you/PRP choose/VB the/DT deep/JJ fried/VBD stuff/NN ,/, then/RB it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB so/RB good/JJ ./. But/CC soaking/VBG deep/JJ fried/VBD stuff/NN in/IN water/NN first/JJ does/VB remove/VB some/JJ of/IN the/DT oil/NN ./. If/IN you/PRP want/VB something/NN healthy/JJ ,/, this/DT is/VBZ NOT/RB the/DT Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN to/TO go/VB for/IN ./. They/PRP do/VBP n't/RB blanch/VB their/PRP$ stuff/NN in/IN water/NN ,/, they/PRP actually/RB deep/VB fry/VB everything/NN before/IN serving/VBG it/PRP in/IN a/DT Soy/NN based/VBD minced/NN pork/NN sauce/NN ./. So/CC even/RB the/DT healthy/JJ stuff/NN like/IN fresh/JJ tofu/NN and/CC lady/NN 's/POS finger/NN gets/VBZ deep/JJ fried/VBD in/IN the/DT oil/NN ./. But/CC that/WDT is/VBZ what/WP makes/VBZ this/DT Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN so/RB shiok/JJ !/. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP the/DT type/NN that/WDT finds/VBZ Yong/NNP Tau/NNP Foo/NNP a/DT bit/NN bland/NN then/RB this/DT one/CD will/MD tingle/VB your/PRP$ taste/NN buds/NN and/CC change/NN your/PRP$ mind/NN !/. Although/CC they/PRP do/VBP n't/RB use/VB any/DT pork/NN in/IN their/PRP$ filling/NN ,/, their/PRP$ Ngoh/NN Hiang/NN and/CC wontans/NNS are/VBP all/RB very/RB savoury/JJ and/CC yummy/JJ ./. Ah/UH a/DT Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN with/IN oooomph/NN !/. The/DT other/JJ thing/NN that/WDT is/VBZ unique/RB about/IN this/DT YTF/JJ the/DT thick/JJ beehoon/NN that/WDT is/VBZ served/VBD with/IN a/DT meat/NN sauce/NN made/VBD from/IN Chicken/NNP Mince/NNP ./. According/VBG to/TO the/DT Alex/NN ,/, the/DT stallowner/NN ,/, this/DT style/NN of/IN Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN was/VBD first/JJ introduced/VBD by/IN him/PRP 10/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./. The/DT stall/NN had/VBD subsequently/RB become/VBN so/RB popular/JJ that/IN they/PRP moved/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT corner/JJ coffeshop/NN in/IN Siglap/NN to/TO become/VBN a/DT standalone/NN restaurant/NN ./. Conclusion/NN For/IN those/DT who/WP want/VB some/JJ ooomph/NN in/IN their/PRP$ Yong/NN Tau/NN Foo/NN !/.
