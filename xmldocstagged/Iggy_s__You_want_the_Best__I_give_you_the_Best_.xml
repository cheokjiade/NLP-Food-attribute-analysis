<title>Iggy's: You want the Best? I give you the Best!</title>
<text>Dining/VBN in/IN a/DT restaurant/NN like/IN Iggy/NNP 's/POS is/VBZ something/NN you/PRP wait/VB for/IN an/DT occasion/NN to/TO do/VB ./. Spending/DT $/$ 150/CD +/NNP +/NNP +/NNP per/NNP head/NN for/IN a/DT meal/NN is/VBZ not/RB something/NN I/PRP do/VBP every/DT day/NN -LRB-/NN month\/year/NN -RRB-/NN especially/RB when/WRB that/WDT money/NN has/VBZ to/TO come/VB out/IN from/IN my/PRP$ own/JJ pocket/NN !/. Now/JJ ,/, if/IN you/PRP are/VBP entertaining/VBG an/DT important/JJ guest/NN and/CC you/PRP have/VB a/DT company/JJ account/NN ,/, then/RB that/WDT 's/POS a/DT different/JJ story/NN ./. Just/RB in/IN case/NN you/PRP are/VBP ,/, would/MD you/PRP please/VB let/VB me/PRP know/VB what/WP kind/NN of/IN business/NN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN and/CC how/WRB I/PRP can/MD become/VBN one/CD of/IN your/PRP$ important/JJ guest/NN ?/. So/RB ,/, the/DT big/JJ occasion/NN just/RB happens/VBZ to/TO be/VB our/PRP$ 20th/JJ ``/NN going/NN out/IN ''/NNP anniversary/NNP ./. Yep/JJ ,/, it/PRP was/VBD 20/CD years/NNS ago/RB ,/, on/IN that/WDT fateful/JJ day/NN ,/, when/RB an/DT anxious/JJ young/JJ student/NN asked/VBD to/TO hold/VB the/DT hand/NN of/IN a/DT lovely/RB young/JJ college/NN mate/NN ./. And/CC the/DT rest/NN as/IN they/PRP say/VBP ,/, is/VBZ history/NN ./. You/PRP do/VBP n't/RB pay/VB such/IN an/DT amount/NN of/IN money/NN simply/NN to/TO fill/VB your/PRP$ tummy/NN you/PRP know/VB ./. No/JJ ,/, you/PRP are/VBP buying/JJ memories/NN ./. If/IN I/PRP were/VBD to/TO ask/VB you/PRP to/TO recount/VB the/DT best/JJ dining/NN experiences/IN you/PRP 've/VBP had/VBN ,/, you/PRP 'd/MD probably/RB be/VB able/JJ to/TO vividly/VB recall/VBP a/DT few/JJ outstanding/JJ ones/NNS ./. Thanks/JJ to/TO the/DT marvel/NN of/IN technology/NN ,/, I/PRP can/MD now/RB blog/VB it/PRP for/IN posterity/NN ./. So/RB ,/, when/WRB we/PRP celebrate/VBD our/PRP$ 40th/JJ anniversary/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD look/VB up/VB this/DT blog/NN and/CC remember/VB what/WP $/$ 150/CD could/MD buy/VB back/RB in/IN 2006/NN ./. Although/CC this/DT is/VBZ an/DT 8/CD course/NN degustation/NN menu/NN ,/, it/PRP actually/RB worked/VBD out/RP to/TO be/VB 11/JJ courses/NN because/IN of/IN 2/CD bonus/NN ``/NN Palate/NN Fresheners/NN ''/NN and/CC an/DT extra/JJ anniversay/NN special/JJ that/IN Iggy/PRP prepared/VBD for/IN us/PRP ./. First/JJ out/IN was/VBD one/CD of/IN these/DT bonus/NN items/NNS ./. The/DT Green/NN Pea/NN Soup/NN is/VBZ reminiscent/JJ of/IN that/WDT famous/JJ dish/NN created/VBD by/IN Ferran/NN Adria/NN and/CC I/PRP was/VBD keen/JJ to/TO taste/VB it/PRP ./. The/DT waiter/NN came/VBD by/IN and/CC instructed/VB us/PRP to/TO take/VB it/PRP all/RB at/IN one/CD go/VB so/RB that/IN you/PRP can/MD taste/VB the/DT hot/JJ foam/NN on/IN top/JJ ,/, the/DT cold/JJ pea/NN soup/NN at/IN the/DT bottom/NN and/CC the/DT hint/NN of/IN mint/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN ./. So/RB begins/IN our/PRP$ Iggy/NN 's/POS experience/NN ./. Next/CC up/RP are/VBP the/DT Canapes/NN ./. We/PRP were/VBD to/TO start/VB from/IN right/NN to/TO left/JJ ./. The/DT tomato/NN foam/NN was/VBD interesting/JJ in/IN that/WDT you/PRP taste/VB the/DT tomatoes/NN but/CC do/VBP n't/RB see/VB the/DT red/JJ color/NN -LRB-/NN Albino/NN Tomato/NN !/. -RRB-/LS ./. Mixed/NNP with/IN the/DT salty/NN ,/, tangy/NN ponzu/NN jelly/NN and/CC spanner/NN crab/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ what/WP I/PRP would/MD imagine/VB the/DT arctic/JJ ocean/NN would/MD taste/VB like/IN ./. Could/DT hardly/JJ make/VB out/IN the/DT sashimi/JJ spanner/NN crabmeat/NN which/WRB was/VBD sandwiched/VBD between/IN the/DT foam/NN and/CC the/DT jelly/NN ,/, though/IN ./. The/DT Ikura/NN and/CC egg/NN pudding/NN was/VBD quite/RB interesting/JJ ./. I/PRP never/RB really/RB ate/VBD Ikura/NNS before/IN ,/, so/RB the/DT feeling/VBG of/IN the/DT salty/NN roe/NN bursting/NN in/IN my/PRP$ mouth/NN was/VBD quite/RB an/DT interesting/JJ experience/NN which/WDT was/VBD mellowed/RB by/IN the/DT creamy/JJ egg/NN pudding/NN ./. The/DT Foie/NN Gras/NN Brulee/NN was/VBD to/TO die/VB for/IN ./. Savoury/JJ taste/NN of/IN Foie/NN Gras/NN with/IN the/DT texture/NN of/IN creme/NN brulee/NN and/CC topped/VBD with/IN that/WDT sweet/JJ caramel/NN crust/NN .../: ./. Sir/WP .../: ./. please/PRP can/MD I/PRP have/VBP some/JJ more/NN ?/. We/PRP 've/VBP always/RB like/VB Rocket/NN Salad/NN ,/, but/CC Iggy/RB has/VB added/VBD a/DT delectable/NN slice/NN of/IN Tuna/NNP belly/NNP and/CC garnished/VBD it/PRP with/IN an/DT amazingly/RB yummy/JJ truffle/NN mayo/NN ./. Wonderful/DT combination/NN of/IN fresh/JJ tasting/VBG rocket/NN ,/, savoury/NN cheese/NN and/CC rich/JJ flavor/NN of/IN Tuna/NNP Belly/NNP ./. I/PRP have/VBP fallen/VBN in/IN love/RB with/IN the/DT Turbot/NN ./. It/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT flat/JJ fish/NN much/RB like/IN the/DT sole/NN and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ the/DT most/JJ incredible/JJ creamy/JJ ,/, delicate/JJ flavor/NN ./. The/DT richness/NN of/IN the/DT champagne/JJ nage/NN -LRB-/IN A/DT nage/NN is/VBZ simply/RB a/DT broth/NN made/VBD from/IN crustaceans/NNP -RRB-/NNP is/VBZ contrasted/RB with/IN the/DT tangy/JJ tomato/NN concassee/NN -LRB-/NN nice/JJ way/NN of/IN saying/VBG roughly/RB chopped/VBN -RRB-/NN and/CC peppered/NN with/IN what/WP was/VBD presumed/VBD to/TO be/VB cavier/NN ./. It/PRP is/VBZ in/IN fact/NN not/RB cavier/JJ but/CC imitation/JJ cavier/NN made/VBD from/IN the/DT common/NN Herring/NN and/CC colored/NN with/IN Squid/NN Ink/NN ./. It/PRP tastes/VBZ smoky/NN and/CC lemony/NN and/CC is/VBZ actually/RB quite/RB good/JJ -LRB-/NN Well/RB ,/, I/PRP have/VBP never/RB tasted/VBD the/DT really/RB good/JJ cavier/NN so/IN I/PRP am/VBP not/RB the/DT best/JJS judge/NN -RRB-/NN ./. Very/DT nice/JJ ,/, but/CC eh/JJ ,/, Iggy/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP paying/VBG quite/RB a/DT bit/NN of/IN money/NN for/IN this/DT meal/NN ,/, surely/NN you/PRP can/MD put/VB in/IN some/NN of/IN the/DT real/JJ stuff/NN ?/. Avruga/JJ Caviar/NN is/VBZ less/JJ then/RB a/DT tenth/JJ the/DT price/NN of/IN the/DT cheapest/JJS caviar/NN ./. Maybe/NNP Iggy/NNP 's/POS out/RP to/TO save/VB the/DT sturgeons/JJ eh/NN ?/. Truffle/JJ lovers/NNS rejoice/RB !/. You/PRP get/VB a/DT good/JJ few/JJ slices/NNS of/IN the/DT prized/JJ white/JJ truffles/JJ found/JJ mainly/NN in/IN Alba/NN ,/, Italy/NN ./. These/DT truffles/JJ can/NN cost/NN up/NN to/TO $/$ 8000/CD per/NN kilogram/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ why/WRB the/DT menu/NN specifically/RB tells/VBZ us/PRP that/WDT there/EX are/VBP 2g/JJ here/RB ./. Ie/. these/DT little/JJ slivers/NN cost/NN $/$ 16/CD !/. Only/RB real/JJ cavier/NN costs/VBZ more/RB ./. I/PRP like/VB them/PRP ,/, but/CC frankly/RB I/PRP could/MD buy/VB quite/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN shiokadoo/NN stuff/NN for/IN that/DT amount/NN of/IN money/NN ,/, know/VB what/WP I/PRP mean/VB ?/. The/DT linguine/NN is/VBZ tossed/RB in/IN a/DT chicken/NN based/VBD sauce/NN and/CC complimented/NN beautifully/JJ by/IN the/DT aromatic/NN truffles/NN ./. This/DT one/CD I/PRP am/VBP quite/RB frankly/RB dissppointed/VBD ./. Up/JJ to/TO this/DT stage/NN ,/, everything/NN was/VBD fantastic/JJ ./. But/CC hey/NNP ,/, charcoal/NNP grilling/NNP a/DT watermelon/NN does/VBZ nothing/NN to/TO it/PRP and/CC I/PRP felt/VBD the/DT balsalmic/NN dressing/VBG did/VBD not/RB go/VB well/RB with/IN the/DT water/NN melon/NN ./. Now/RB ,/, if/IN it/PRP were/VBD a/DT piece/NN of/IN rock/NN melon/NN or/CC Japanese/NNP musk/NNP melon/NNP it/PRP might/VB have/VB worked/VBN better/RBR .../: I/PRP think/VB ./. Watermelons/DT really/RB lack/VB in/IN any/DT special/JJ taste/NN and/CC is/VBZ in/IN my/PRP$ opinion/NN best/JJS served/VBN cold/JJ ./. After/IN the/DT dissapointing/NN watermelon/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD treated/JJ to/TO this/DT really/RB darn/JJ shiok/NN suckling/NN pig/NN ./. Wow/NN ,/, talk/VB about/IN hitting/VBG the/DT spot/NN ./. The/DT pangness/NN -LRB-/NN umami/NN ,/, savoury/NN taste/NN -RRB-/NN of/IN the/DT suckling/NN pig/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT equally/JJ pang/NN -LRB-/NN savoury/NN -RRB-/NN creamy/JJ mashed/NN potato/NN ,/, balanced/VBN by/IN the/DT sweetness/NN of/IN the/DT apple/NN puree/NN and/CC that/IN the/DT shiok/JJ shiok/NN veal/NN jus/NN -LRB-/NN sauce/NN made/VBD from/IN pan/CD juices/NNS of/IN roasting/NN meat/NN -RRB-/JJ and/CC incredible/JJ tumeric/JJ oil/NN ./. Pow/NNP !!!/NNP Please/NNP Sir/NNP .../: ./. I/PRP want/VB some/JJ more/NN !/. Vacherin/JJ ,/, I/PRP am/VBP told/JJ ,/, is/VBZ a/DT cheese/NN made/VBD from/IN cow/NN 's/POS milk/NN and/CC often/NN served/VBD as/IN a/DT fondue/NN ./. This/DT dish/NN is/VBZ served/VBD hot/JJ because/IN they/PRP have/VBP to/TO first/JJ melt/IN the/DT cheese/NN on/IN the/DT plate/NN in/IN the/DT oven/NN ,/, then/RB put/VB the/DT mache/JJ -LRB-/NN lamb/NN 's/POS lettuce/NN on/IN top/JJ -RRB-/. The/DT cheese/NN is/VBZ rich/JJ ,/, chewy/JJ and/CC creamy/JJ and/CC very/RB nice/JJ with/IN the/DT Kipfler/NNP -LRB-/NNP German/NNP finger/NNP potatoes/NNS -RRB-/RB ./. Gimme/RB a/DT pot/NN ,/, let/VB me/PRP melt/VB this/DT cheese/NN and/CC dip/VB some/JJ brioche/NN in/IN it/PRP !/. I/PRP would/MD die/VB happy/JJ ./. After/JJ all/NN that/WDT ,/, it/PRP was/VBD time/NN for/IN the/DT 2nd/CD bonus/NN ``/NN Palate/NN Freshener/NN ''/NN ./. Hmm/. I/PRP especially/RB liked/VBD the/DT candied/NN tomatoes/NN !/. Very/JJ nice/NN ./. The/DT Souffle/NN was/VBD nice/JJ but/CC compared/VBD to/TO the/DT other/JJ items/NNS ,/, this/DT one/CD lacked/IN the/DT knock/NN out/IN punch/NN for/IN me/PRP ./. As/IN far/JJ as/IN Souffles/RB go/VB ,/, this/DT was/VBD well/RB executed/JJ ,/, but/CC I/PRP would/MD have/VB prefered/VBN something/NN less/JJ coconutty/NN ./. We/PRP had/VBD a/DT great/JJ and/CC memorable/JJ dining/NN experience/NN ./. Iggy/DT 's/POS as/IN you/PRP may/MD already/RB know/VB is/VBZ the/DT only/JJ Singaporean/NN Restaurant/NN to/TO be/VB listing/VBN in/IN the/DT top/JJ 100/CD restaurants/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ ranked/JJ 4th/NN in/IN Asia/NN ./. So/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP trying/VBG to/TO impress/VB that/IN special/JJ someone/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT place/NN to/TO go/VB !/. -LRB-/NNP T4/NNP +/NNP V2/NNP +/NNP S2/NNP +/NNP E1/NNP -RRB-/. Some/DT may/MD disagree/VB with/IN me/PRP on/IN the/DT Value/NNP component/NNP because/IN you/PRP can/MD argue/VB that/WDT we/PRP really/RB got/VBD our/PRP$ money/NN 's/POS worth/NN ./. Then/RB again/RB ,/, a/DT place/NN like/IN Iggy/NNP 's/POS does/VBZ not/RB and/CC should/VB not/RB position/NN itself/PRP as/IN value/NN for/IN money/NN ./. Then/RB you/PRP would/MD attract/VB the/DT wrong/JJ crowd/NN and/CC spoil/VB the/DT whole/JJ dining/NN experience/NN ./. I/PRP will/VB give/VB you/PRP one/CD simple/JJ example/NN ./. I/PRP ordered/VBD a/DT cup/NN of/IN tea/NN to/TO accompany/VB my/PRP$ dessert/NN and/CC that/IN cost/NN me/PRP $/$ 8/CD +/NN +/NN +/NN ./. It/PRP was/VBD n't/RB in/IN a/DT teapot/NN or/CC anything/NN ,/, just/RB a/DT plain/NN cup/NN with/IN freshly/JJ brewed/VBD tea/NN in/IN it/PRP ./. If/IN this/DT whole/JJ meal/NN had/VBD cost/NN $/$ 100/CD per/NN head/NN including/NN tea/NN and/CC coffee/NN ,/, THAT/NN would/MD have/VB been/VBN value/NN for/IN money/NN ./. </text>
