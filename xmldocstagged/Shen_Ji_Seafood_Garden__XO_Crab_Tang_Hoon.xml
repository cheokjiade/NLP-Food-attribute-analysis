<text>This/DT is/VBZ the/DT age/NN of/IN information/NN ./. So/RB there/RB is/VBZ no/RB good/JJ reason/NN why/WRB one/CD should/MD waste/VB one/CD 's/POS calories/NNS on/IN bad/JJ food/NN when/WRB information/VBZ on/IN really/RB yummy/JJ and/CC shiokelicious/JJ food/NN is/VBZ just/RB a/DT couple/NN of/IN clicks/NN away/RB ./. It/PRP just/RB so/RB happens/VBZ that/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ another/JJ Saturday/NN night/NN and/CC I/PRP have/VB a/DT whole/JJ family/NN including/NN Mom/NN ,/, the/DT in-laws/NN ,/, the/DT kids/NNS ,/, and/CC -LRB-/VB my/PRP$ kids/NNS '/" GodParents/NN -RRB-/NN to/TO feed/VB ./. Who/WP ya/IN gonna/PRP call/VBP ?/. A/DT few/JJ clicks/NNS of/IN the/DT handphone/NN buttons/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS an/DT SMS/NN from/IN a/DT well/RB trusted/JJ source/NN recommended/IN this/DT Cze/NNP Char/NNP at/IN the/DT cnr/NN of/IN Holland/NN V/NN and/CC Commonwealth/NN Ave/NN ,/, just/RB 5/CD minutes/NN drive/NN from/IN Church/NN ./. Phwa/JJ !/. XO/DT crabs/NN !/. Sounds/DT great/JJ !/. And/CC it/PRP was/VBD !/. I/PRP loved/VBD the/DT XO/NNP Crab/NNP Tang/NNP Hoon/NNP ./. Tang/JJ Hoon/NN has/VBZ this/DT amazing/JJ ability/NN to/TO absorb/VB all/RB the/DT tastes/VBZ of/IN the/DT crab/NN ,/, ginger/NN ,/, stock/NN ,/, oyster/NN sauce/NN ,/, garlic/NN and/CC of/IN course/NN the/DT XO/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT most/JJ mind/NN blowing/NN bolus/NN of/IN tastebud/NN tinglers/NN ./. Man/JJ ,/, I/PRP love/VBP Crab/NNP Tang/NNP Hoon/NNP ./. The/DT crab/NN was/VBD ,/, however/RB not/RB as/IN impressive/NN ./. The/DT meat/NN was/VBD a/DT bit/NN powdery/NN ,/, so/RB it/PRP was/VBD a/DT bit/NN of/IN a/DT letdown/NN ./. BUT/JJ for/IN those/RB who/WP love/VB roe/NN ,/, eat/VB your/PRP$ heart/NN out/IN -LRB-/NNP pun/NNP intended/NNP -RRB-/NNP ./. $/$ 22/CD I/PRP would/MD have/VB scored/VBD them/PRP if/IN the/DT crab/NN was/VBD solid/RB ./. But/CC I/PRP will/MD definitely/RB come/VB back/RB and/CC eat/VB this/DT again/RB !/. Next/CC up/RP is/VBZ the/DT Sweet/NNP Corn/NNP Cream/NN Prawn/NNP ./. Large/NNP King/NNP Prawns/NNP are/VBP deep/JJ fried/VBN in/IN batter/NN and/CC then/RB coated/VBN with/IN this/DT creamy/JJ sweet/JJ corn/NN sauce/NN that/IN hints/NN of/IN condensed/NN milk/NN and/CC curry/NN leaves/VBZ ./. This/DT is/VBZ really/RB very/RB good/JJ and/CC definitely/RB a/DT must/VB try/VB ./. One/PRP may/MD complain/VB that/IN the/DT prawns/NNS are/VBP not/RB live/JJ prawns/NNS but/CC for/IN me/PRP the/DT only/RB way/NN to/TO eat/VB live/JJ prawns/NNS is/VBZ plainly/RB steamed/JJ ./. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB mind/VB unlive/NN prawns/NNS done/VBN this/DT way/NN ./. $/$ 20/CD The/DT Mongolian/NNP Pork/NNP Ribs/NNP were/VBD very/RB good/JJ ./. The/DT pork/NN ribs/NNS were/VBD large/JJ ,/, beyond/PRP bite/VB sized/VBD pieces/NN ,/, but/CC were/VBD still/RB very/RB tender/JJ and/CC did/VBD not/RB hint/NN of/IN the/DT use/VB of/IN bicarb/NN ./. The/DT sauce/NN was/VBD grainy/JJ and/CC rough/JJ ,/, more/JJ tangy/NN and/CC savoury/NN then/RB sweet/JJ ./. It/PRP was/VBD good/JJ ,/, but/CC next/JJ time/NN I/PRP will/VB try/VB ordering/VBG their/PRP$ Jing/NNP Dou/NNP Pai/NNP Kuat/NNP ./. $/$ 10/CD This/DT is/VBZ another/DT really/RB good/JJ dish/NN ./. Homemade/JJ Tofu/NN -LRB-/NN made/VBD from/IN soy/NNP milk/NNP and/CC eggs/NNP -RRB-/NNP is/VBZ first/RB deep/JJ fried/VBD and/CC then/RB drown/VBD in/IN a/DT mince/VB pork/NN and/CC long/JJ bean/NN gravy/NN ./. Simple/JJ but/CC darn/JJ shiok/NN with/IN rice/NN !/. $/$ 8/CD Everyone/NNS loved/VBD the/DT live/JJ Patin/NN Fish/NN with/IN Deep/NNP Fried/NNP Chye/NNP Poh/NNP and/CC Garlic/NNP ./. Different/JJ from/IN your/PRP$ usual/JJ Cantonese/NNP Steamed/NNP Fish/NNP ./. The/DT Patin/NN has/VBZ that/IN extra/JJ layer/NN of/IN fat/NN and/CC really/RB smooth/JJ flesh/NN which/WRB combined/VBZ perfectly/RB with/IN the/DT soy/NN ,/, garlic/NN and/CC chye/NNP poh/NNP ./. Lately/JJ ,/, I/PRP have/VB noticed/VBD more/JJ and/CC more/JJ people/NNS deep/VB frying/VBG chye/NNP poh/NNP and/CC using/VBG it/PRP as/IN a/DT garnish/NN ./. It/PRP really/RB works/VB !/. $/$ 39/. The/DT Slice/NNP Fish/NNP horfun/NNP was/VBD good/JJ but/CC not/RB as/IN good/JJ as/IN those/RB served/VBD in/IN more/JJ specialized/NNP Fish/NNP Head/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN places/NNS like/IN the/DT one/CD I/PRP like/VB over/IN at/IN Alexandra/NNP Village/NNP -LRB-/. That/DT is/VBZ a/DT future/JJ blog/NN -RRB-/NN ./. $/$ 8/CD Again/RB the/DT Fish/NNP Head/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN Soup/NN lacked/IN the/DT sweet/JJ taste/NN of/IN really/RB good/JJ Fish/NNP Head/NNP Bee/NN Hoon/NN Soup/NN ./. Nice/JJ but/CC I/PRP will/VB try/VB something/NN else/RB next/JJ time/NN ./. $/$ 8/CD No/RB wonder/VB there/RB were/VBD so/RB many/JJ people/NNS at/IN this/DT Cze/NNP Char/NNP ./. Apparently/RB they/PRP already/RB have/VB 6/CD branches/NNS all/RB over/IN the/DT island/NN !/. The/DT most/NN wonderful/JJ thing/NN is/VBZ that/RB after/IN everyone/PRP had/VBD raved/VBN about/IN how/RB much/RB they/PRP loved/VBD the/DT food/NN ,/, the/DT bill/NN only/RB came/VBD up/RP to/TO $/$ 131/CD amongst/NN 8/CD adults/NN !/. That/DT was/VBD like/IN $/$ 16/CD per/NN head/NN to/TO eat/VB a/DT really/RB great/JJ meal/NN with/IN Crab/NNP ,/, Live/NNP Fish/NNP and/CC King/NNP Prawns/NNP !/. The/DT only/RB real/JJ letdown/NN was/VBD the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT crab/NN ,/, which/WRB I/PRP am/VBP willing/JJ to/TO pang/VB chance/NN -LRB-/NN forgive/NN -RRB-/NN ./. I/PRP am/VBP already/RB planning/VBG the/DT next/JJ Cze/NNP Char/NNP outing/NNP at/IN their/PRP$ branch/NN in/IN Changi/NNP Village/NNP ./. -LRB-/NNP T3/NNP .5/NNP +/NNP V2/NNP .75/NNP +/NNP S1/NNP .5/NNP +/NNP E1/NNP -RRB-/NNP Marked/NNP down/NN on/IN Service/NNP because/IN you/PRP have/VBP to/TO wait/VB almost/RB half/JJ and/CC hour/JJ before/IN the/DT food/NN arrives/NN ./.
