<title>Nasi Bawean: Cooking with Charcoal since WWII!</title>
<text>I/PRP have/VBP been/VBN wanting/VBG to/TO blog/VB about/IN Nasi/NNP Bawean/NNP from/IN the/DT very/RB early/JJ days/NNS of/IN the/DT blog/NN but/CC somehow/NN I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB manage/VB to/TO get/VB around/IN it/PRP until/IN recently/RB ./. The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT stall/NN is/VBZ so/RB popular/JJ that/IN it/PRP often/RB sells/VBZ out/IN by/IN the/DT time/NN I/PRP finish/VBD seeing/VBG my/PRP$ last/JJ patient/NN and/CC rush/NN down/NN for/IN lunch/NN ./. However/RB ,/, my/PRP$ friend/NN ,/, SCS/NNP Butter/NNP told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT lately/IN they/PRP have/VBP been/VBN closing/VBG a/DT little/JJ later/NN because/IN of/IN some/JJ road/NN works/NN that/WDT are/VBP being/VBG carried/NN out/IN just/RB outside/IN the/DT shop/NN which/WDT is/VBZ affecting/IN their/PRP$ visibility/NN ./. So/CC I/PRP quickly/RB took/VBD the/DT opportunity/NN to/TO make/VB my/PRP$ way/NN down/NN to/TO this/DT very/RB popular/JJ Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP joint/NNP ./. l/NNP This/NNP Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP is/VBZ located/VBN in/IN an/DT old/JJ coffee/NN shop/NN which/WRB exudes/VBZ the/DT kind/NN of/IN old/JJ world/NN charm/NN that/WDT is/VBZ fast/RB disappearing/JJ from/IN our/PRP$ rapidly/JJ changing/NN landscape/NN ./. I/PRP was/VBD n't/RB at/IN all/DT surprised/VBD with/IN the/DT coffee/NN shop/NN owner/NN told/VBD me/PRP that/WDT Nasi/NNP Bawean/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN around/RB since/IN WWII/NN !/. It/PRP certainly/RB looks/VBZ it/PRP ./. Now/RB any/DT food/NN establishment/NN 's/POS longevity/NN can/MD usually/RB be/VB attributed/VBD to/TO really/RB good/JJ food/NN and/CC Nasi/NNP Bawean/NNP is/VBZ no/RB exception/JJ ./. Part/DT of/IN the/DT reason/NN why/WRB their/PRP$ food/NN is/VBZ so/RB good/JJ is/VBZ because/IN they/PRP are/VBP still/RB cooking/JJ things/NN with/IN good/JJ old/JJ charcoal/NN ,/, the/DT way/NN that/IN it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN done/VBN for/IN the/DT longest/JJ time/NN ./. You/PRP might/VB be/VB wondering/VBG how/RB cooking/JJ over/IN charcoal/NN can/MD make/VB things/NN taste/NN better/NN than/IN when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ cooked/VBN over/IN gas/NN ?/. Well/RB ,/, the/DT truth/NN is/VBZ ,/, I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB really/RB know/VB ./. But/CC it/PRP does/VBZ have/VBN something/NN to/TO do/VB with/IN the/DT different/JJ way/NN heat/NN from/IN charcoal/NN and/CC gas/NN is/VBZ dissipated/RB ./. A/DT pot/NN of/IN water/NN cooked/VBN over/IN charcoal/NN does/VBZ n't/RB over/IN boil/NN ./. It/PRP just/RB keeps/VBZ simmering/RB away/RB slowly/JJ ./. That/DT is/VBZ why/RB charcoal/JJ is/VBZ still/RB the/DT preferred/JJ way/NN to/TO keep/VB a/DT kettle/NN of/IN water/NN hot/JJ when/WRB you/PRP are/VBP enjoying/VBG gung/DT fu/JJ tea/NN with/IN friends/NNS ./. You/PRP just/RB have/VB the/DT leave/VB the/DT water/NN over/IN the/DT charcoal/NN and/CC you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO bother/VB about/IN adjusting/VBG the/DT heat/NN as/IN you/PRP would/MD with/IN an/DT electric/NN or/CC gas/NN kettle/NN ./. The/DT food/NN here/RB is/VBZ very/RB good/JJ ./. Although/CC it/PRP is/VBZ named/VBD Bawean/JJ after/IN the/DT small/JJ island/NN off/IN Surabaya/NN ,/, Indonesia/NN where/WRB the/DT family/NN originated/NN from/IN ,/, the/DT dishes/NNS have/VB more/JJ or/CC less/JJ evolved/NN to/TO take/VB on/IN the/DT characteristics/NN of/IN the/DT more/JJ familiar/JJ Nasi/NNP Padang/NNP dishes/NNS that/IN we/PRP see/VBP here/RB in/IN Singapore/NNP ./. I/PRP would/MD recommend/VB the/DT Stingray/NNP Assam/NNP Pedas/NNP ,/, Ayam/NNP Kicap/NNP Manis/NNS and/CC Beef/NN Rendang/NN here/RB as/IN they/PRP are/VBP excellent/JJ ./. Conclusion/NN It/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB get/VB as/IN old/JJ school/NN as/IN this/DT !/. Nasi/NNP Bawean/NNP 62/NNP Desker/NNP Road/NNP Singapore/NNP 209587/NNP 10.30/NNP am/VBZ to/TO 3pm/NNP Closed/NNP Sundays/NNP 93399433/NNP </text>
