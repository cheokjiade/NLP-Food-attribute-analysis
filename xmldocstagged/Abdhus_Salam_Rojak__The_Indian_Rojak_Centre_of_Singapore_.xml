<title>Abdhus Salam Rojak: The Indian Rojak Centre of Singapore!</title>
<text>The/DT more/JJ senior/JJ readers/NNS amongst/NN us/PRP will/MD no/RB doubt/VB remember/VB the/DT Indian/JJ Rojak/NN stalls/NNS that/WDT used/VBD to/TO line/NNP Waterloo/NNP Street/NNP ./. I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB my/PRP$ dad/NN ever/RB brought/VBN me/PRP there/RB to/TO eat/VB Indian/NN Rojak/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP am/VBP sure/JJ that/WDT it/PRP must/MD have/VB been/VBN quite/RB something/NN for/IN people/NN to/TO still/VB talk/VB about/IN it/PRP so/RB fondly/JJ !/. Another/DT defunct/JJ hawker/NN center/NN that/IN I/PRP often/VBP heard/VBN mentioned/VBD is/VBZ the/DT one/CD at/IN the/DT open/JJ air/NN carpark/NN along/IN Shenton/NNP Way/NNP ./. These/DT were/VBD the/DT places/NNS where/WRB you/PRP could/MD find/VB all/RB the/DT local/JJ Mamak/NN favorites/NNS like/IN Mee/NNP Goreng/NNP ,/, Sup/NNP Kambing/NNP and/CC of/IN course/NN ,/, Indian/NN Rojak/NN ./. So/RB where/WRB is/VBZ the/DT new/JJ center/NN for/IN Indian/NN Rojak/NN ?/. Well/RB ,/, I/PRP would/MD argue/VB that/IN it/PRP would/MD be/VB at/IN Ayer/NNP Rajah/NNP Food/NNP Centre/NN where/RB a/DT lot/NN of/IN the/DT hawkers/NNS from/IN Shenton/NNP Way/NNP were/VBD relocated/NN to/TO when/WRB they/PRP were/VBD chased/JJ off/IN the/DT streets/NN ./. Even/RB if/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB consider/VB it/PRP to/TO be/VB the/DT Indian/JJ Rojak/NN center/NN of/IN Singapore/NNP now/RB ,/, you/PRP certainly/RB will/VB in/IN 20/CD years/NNS '/" time/NN ./. Let/WP me/PRP tell/VBP you/PRP why/RB ./. There/EX are/VBP two/CD excellent/JJ Indian/NN Rojak/NN stalls/NNS here/RB along/IN the/DT same/JJ row/NN facing/VBG the/DT carpark/NN which/WDT are/VBZ still/RB making/VBG all/DT of/IN their/PRP$ items/NNS by/IN hand/NN ./. I/PRP have/VBP written/VBN about/IN Habib/NNP 's/POS Rojak/NN previously/NN and/CC now/RB I/PRP am/VBP very/RB happy/JJ to/TO add/VB Abdhus/DT Salam/JJ Rojak/NN which/WDT is/VBZ located/VBN just/RB a/DT few/JJ stalls/NNS down/RB ./. Interestingly/. both/DT of/IN these/DT stalls/NNS are/VBP now/RB run/VB by/IN Gen/NNP Y/NNP hawkers/NNS who/WP have/VBZ taken/VBN over/IN the/DT reins/NN from/IN their/PRP$ fathers/NN ./. But/CC did/VBD you/PRP know/VB that/IN the/DT hawkers/NNS actually/RB named/VBD the/DT stalls/NN after/IN the/DT two/CD boys/NNS when/WRB they/PRP were/VBD still/RB babies/JJ ?/. Now/RB they/PRP will/VB take/VB over/IN a/DT stall/NN that/WDT is/VBZ eponymously/RB named/VBD after/IN them/PRP !/. Talk/JJ about/IN self/NNP fulfilling/NNP prophecies/NNP !/. Abdhus/NNP Salam/NNP had/VBD been/VBN helping/VBG out/IN at/IN his/PRP$ father/NN 's/POS stall/NN for/IN the/DT last/JJ 10/CD years/NNS while/RB studying/VBG to/TO be/VB an/DT engineer/NN ./. After/IN he/PRP received/VBZ his/PRP$ degree/NN ,/, he/PRP worked/VBD as/IN an/DT assistant/JJ engineer/NN in/IN the/DT semi-conductor/NN industry/NN for/IN two/CD years/NNS before/IN he/PRP felt/VBD the/DT calling/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT hawker/NN ./. ``/. I/PRP felt/VBD that/WDT is/VBZ would/MD be/VB such/RB a/DT waste/VB if/IN no/DT one/CD were/VBD to/TO take/VB over/IN the/DT stall/NN which/WDT my/PRP$ father/NN had/VBD worked/VBN so/RB hard/JJ to/TO build/VB all/DT these/DT years/NNS !/. ''/RB Abdus/RB told/VBD me/PRP ./. His/PRP father/NN had/VBD started/VBD selling/VBG Indian/NNP Rojak/NNP at/IN Shenton/NNP Way/NNP and/CC moved/VBD to/TO their/PRP$ present/JJ location/NN when/WRB he/PRP was/VBD just/RB a/DT little/JJ boy/NN ./. Since/CC then/RB he/PRP has/VBZ tirelessly/VBN been/VBN making/VBG all/DT their/PRP$ Rojak/NN items/NNS daily/VBD by/IN hand/NN ./. Like/RB every/DT Gen/NNP Y/NNP hawkerpreneur/. I/PRP know/VBP ,/, Abdhus/PRP does/VBZ dream/NN of/IN running/NN an/DT Indian/JJ Rojak/NN empire/NN one/CD day/NN with/IN a/DT string/NN of/IN Indian/JJ Rojak/NN stalls/NNS selling/VBG great/JJ rojak/NN and/CC Teh/NNP Tarik/NNP all/NN over/IN the/DT island/NN ./. However/RB ,/, even/RB if/IN he/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB eventually/RB become/VBN the/DT Indian/JJ Rojak/NN Rajah/NN ,/, he/PRP tells/VBZ me/PRP he/PRP would/MD be/VB quite/RB happy/JJ if/IN he/PRP continues/VBZ to/TO provide/VB great/JJ rojak/NN at/IN this/DT one/CD stall/NN ./. The/DT rojak/NN here/RB is/VBZ excellent/JJ ,/, its/PRP$ freshly/JJ fried/VBD and/CC crisp/JJ and/CC the/DT sauce/NN tends/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT little/JJ more/JJ spicy/JJ then/RB some/JJ of/IN the/DT other/JJ Indian/NN Rojak/NN stalls/NNS that/WDT I/PRP have/VB blogged/VBD ./. Of/IN note/NNS are/VBP the/DT coconut/NN fritters/NN and/CC the/DT vadai/NN which/WDT really/RB stood/VBN out/IN ./. They/PRP are/VBP still/RB using/VBG freshly/JJ grated/NN coconut/NN to/TO make/VB the/DT fritters/JJ everyday/NN and/CC so/RB you/PRP can/MD really/RB taste/VB the/DT coconut/NN ./. The/DT vadai/NN has/VBZ got/VBN a/DT spicy/JJ punch/NN which/WDT paired/VBZ so/RB well/RB with/IN the/DT sauce/NN ./. The/DT other/JJ items/NNS are/VBP also/RB excellent/JJ ./. I/PRP did/VBD pick/NN up/IN a/DT little/JJ fault/NN though/IN ./. The/DT potatoes/NNS were/VBD just/RB slightly/RB undercooked/VBN so/RB that/IN the/DT inside/NN was/VBD slighty/RB crunchy/JJ instead/RB of/IN being/NN waxy/NN ./. Conclusion/NN It/PRP 's/VBZ great/JJ to/TO the/DT next/JJ generation/NN taking/VBG over/IN their/PRP$ parent/NN 's/POS business/NN !/. If/IN you/PRP are/VBP hankering/JJ for/IN good/JJ Indian/NN Rojak/NN ,/, Ayer/NNP Rajah/NNP Food/NNP Centre/NN is/VBZ the/DT place/NN to/TO go/VB !/.
